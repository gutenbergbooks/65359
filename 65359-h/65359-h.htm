<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">The</span> task of giving some account of Maxwell’s work—of
describing the share that he has taken in the
advance of Physical Science during the latter half
of this nineteenth century—has proved no light
labour. The problems which he attacked are of
such magnitude and complexity, that the attempt
to explain them and their importance, satisfactorily,
without the aid of symbols, is almost foredoomed
to failure. However, the attempt has been made,
in the belief that there are many who, though they
cannot follow the mathematical analysis of Maxwell’s
work, have sufficient general knowledge of physical
ideas and principles to make an account of Maxwell
and of the development of the truths that he discovered,
subjects of intelligent interest.</p>

<p>Maxwell’s life was written in 1882 by two of those
who were most intimately connected with him, Professor
Lewis Campbell and Dr. Garnett. Many of the
biographical details of the earlier part of this book
are taken from their work. My thanks are due to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">vi</span>
them and to their publishers, Messrs. Macmillan, for
permission to use any of the letters which appear
in their biography. I trust that my brief account
may be sufficient to induce many to read Professor
Campbell’s “Life and Letters,” with a view of learning
more of the inner thoughts of one who has
left so strong an imprint on all he undertook, and
was so deeply loved by all who knew him.</p>

<span class="subhead">EARLY LIFE.</span></h2>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">“One</span> who has enriched the inheritance left by
Newton and has consolidated the work of Faraday—one
who impelled the mind of Cambridge to a
fresh course of real investigation—has clearly earned
his place in human memory.” It was thus that
Professor Lewis Campbell and Mr. Garnett began in
1882 their life of James Clerk Maxwell. The years
which have passed, since that date, have all tended to
strengthen the belief in the greatness of Maxwell’s
work and in the fertility of his genius, which has
inspired the labours of those who, not in Cambridge
only, but throughout the world, have aided in developing
the seeds sown by him. My object in the
following pages will be to give some very brief
account of his life and writings, in a form which may,
I hope, enable many to realise what Physical Science
owes to one who was to me a most kind friend as well
as a revered master.</p>

<p>The Clerks of Penicuik, from whom Clerk Maxwell
was descended, were a distinguished family. Sir John
Clerk, the great-great-grandfather of Clerk Maxwell,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
was a Baron of the Exchequer in Scotland from 1707
to 1755; he was also one of the Commissioners of
the Union, and was in many ways an accomplished
scholar. His second son George married a first cousin,
Dorothea Maxwell, the heiress of Middlebie in Dumfriesshire,
and took the name of Maxwell. By the
death of his elder brother James in 1782 George
Clerk Maxwell succeeded to the baronetcy and the
property of Penicuik. Before this time he had
become involved in mining and manufacturing speculations,
and most of the Middlebie property had been
sold to pay his debts.</p>

<p>The property of Sir George Clerk Maxwell descended
in 1798 to his two grandsons, Sir George
Clerk and Mr. John Clerk Maxwell. It had been
arranged that the younger of the two was to take
the remains of the Middlebie property and to assume
with it the name of Maxwell. Sir George Clerk was
member for Midlothian, and held office under Sir
Robert Peel. John Clerk Maxwell was the father of
James Clerk Maxwell, the subject of this sketch.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<p>John Clerk Maxwell lived with his widowed mother
in Edinburgh until her death in 1824. He was a
lawyer, and from time to time did some little
business in the courts. At the same time he maintained
an interest in scientific pursuits, especially
those of a practical nature. Professor Campbell
tells us of an endeavour to devise a bellows which
would give a continuous draught of air. In 1831 he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
contributed to the <i>Edinburgh Medical and Philosophical
Journal</i> a paper entitled “Outlines of a Plan
for combining Machinery with the Manual Printing
Press.”</p>

<p>In 1826 John Clerk Maxwell married Miss Frances
Cay, of North Charlton, Northumberland. For the
first few years of their married life their home was in
Edinburgh. The old estate of Middlebie had been
greatly reduced in extent, and there was not a house
on it in which the laird could live. However, soon
after his marriage, John Clerk Maxwell purchased the
adjoining property of Glenlair and built a mansion-house
for himself and his wife. Mr. Maxwell superintended
the building work. The actual working
plans for some further additions made in 1843 were
his handiwork. A garden was laid out and planted,
and a dreary stony waste was converted into a
pleasant home. For some years after he settled at
Glenlair the house in Edinburgh was retained by Mr.
Maxwell, and here, on June 13, 1831, was born his
only son, James Clerk Maxwell. A daughter, born
earlier, died in infancy. Glenlair, however, was his
parents’ home, and nearly all the reminiscences we
have of his childhood are connected with it. The
laird devoted himself to his estates and to the education
of his son, taking, however, from time to time
his full share in such county business as fell to him.
Glenlair in 1830 was very much in the wilds; the journey
from Edinburgh occupied two days. “Carriages
in the modern sense were hardly known to the Vale of
Urr. A sort of double gig with a hood was the best
apology for a travelling coach, and the most active<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
mode of locomotion was in a kind of rough dog-cart
known in the family speech as a hurly.”<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>

<p>Mrs. Maxwell writes thus<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a>, when the boy was
nearly three years old, to her sister, Miss Jane <span class="locked">Cay:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“He is a very happy man, and has improved much since
the weather got moderate. He has great work with doors,
locks, keys, etc., and ‘Show me how it doos’ is never out of
his mouth. He also investigates the hidden course of streams
and bell-wires—the way the water gets from the pond through
the wall and a pend or small bridge and down a drain into
Water Orr, then past the smiddy and down to the sea, where
Maggy’s ships sail. As to the bells, they will not rust; he
stands sentry in the kitchen and Mag runs through the house
ringing them all by turns, or he rings and sends Bessy to see
and shout to let him know; and he drags papa all over to
show him the holes where the wires go through.”</p>
</div>

<p>To discover “how it doos” was thus early his aim.
His cousin, Mrs. Blackburn, tells us that throughout
his childhood his constant question was, “What’s the
go of that? What does it do?” And if the answer
were too vague or inconclusive, he would add, “But
what’s the <em>particular</em> go of that?”</p>

<p>Professor Campbell’s most interesting account of
these early years is illustrated by a number of
sketches of episodes in his life. In one Maxwell is
absorbed in watching the fiddler at a country dance;
in another he is teaching his dog some tricks; in
a third he is helping a smaller boy in his efforts
to build a castle. Together with his cousin, Miss
Wedderburn, he devised a number of figures for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
toy known as a magic disc, which afterwards developed
into the zoetrope or wheel of life, and in
which, by means of an ingenious contrivance of
mirrors, the impression of a continuous movement
was produced.</p>

<p>This happy life went on until his mother’s death
in December, 1839; she died, at the age of forty-eight,
of the painful disease to which her son afterwards
succumbed. When James, being then eight years old,
was told that she was now in heaven, he said: “Oh,
I’m so glad! Now she’ll have no more pain.”</p>

<p>After this his aunt, Miss Jane Cay, took a mother’s
place. The problem of his education had to be faced,
and the first attempts were not successful. A tutor
had been engaged during Mrs. Maxwell’s last illness,
and he, it seems, tried to coerce Clerk Maxwell into
learning; but such treatment failed, and in 1841,
when ten years old, he began his school-life at the
Edinburgh Academy.</p>

<p>School-life at first had its hardships. Maxwell’s
appearance, his first day at school, in Galloway home-spun
and square-toed shoes with buckles, was more
than his fellows could stand. “Who made those
shoes?” they asked<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a>; and the reply they received
<span class="locked">was—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“Div ye ken ’twas a man,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And he lived in a house,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In whilk was a mouse.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">He returned to Heriot Row that afternoon, says
Professor Campbell, “with his tunic in rags and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
wanting the skirt, his neat frill rumpled and torn—himself
excessively amused by his experiences and
showing not the slightest sign of irritation.”</p>

<p>No. 31, Heriot Row, was the house of his widowed
aunt, Mrs. Wedderburn, Mr. Maxwell’s sister; and
this, with occasional intervals when he was with Miss
Cay, was his home for the next eight or nine years.
Mr. Maxwell himself, during this period, spent much
of his time in Edinburgh, living with his sister during
most of the winter and returning to Glenlair for the
spring and summer.</p>

<p>Much of what we know of Clerk Maxwell’s life
during this period comes from the letters which
passed between him and his father. They tell us of
the close intimacy and affection which existed between
the two, of the boy’s eager desire to please and
amuse his father in the dull solitude of Glenlair, and
his father’s anxiety for his welfare and progress.</p>

<p>Professor Campbell was his schoolfellow, and
records events of those years in which he shared,
which bring clearly before us what Clerk Maxwell
was like. Thus he <span class="locked">writes<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a>:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“He came to know Swift and Dryden, and after a while
Hobbes, and Butler’s ‘Hudibras.’ Then, if his father was in
Edinburgh, they walked together, especially on the Saturday
half-holiday, and ‘viewed’ Leith Fort, or the preparations for
the Granton railway, or the stratification of Salisbury Crags—always
learning something new, and winning ideas for imagination
to feed upon. One Saturday, February 12, 1842, he
had a special treat, being taken ‘to see electro-magnetic
machines.’”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span></p>

<p class="in0">And again, speaking of his <span class="locked">school-life:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“But at school also he gradually made his way. He soon
discovered that Latin was worth learning, and the Greek
Delectus interested him when we got so far. And there were
two subjects in which he at once took the foremost place,
when he had a fair chance of doing so; these were Scripture
Biography and English. In arithmetic as well as in Latin his
comparative want of readiness kept him down.</p>

<p>“On the whole he attained a measure of success which
helped to secure for him a certain respect; and, however
strange he sometimes seemed to his companions, he had three
qualities which they could not fail to understand—agile
strength of limb, imperturbable courage, and profound good-nature.
Professor James Muirhead remembers him as ‘a
friendly boy, though never quite amalgamating with the rest.’
And another old class-fellow, the Rev. W. Macfarlane of
Lenzie, records the following as his impression:—‘Clerk
Maxwell, when he entered the Academy, was somewhat rustic
and somewhat eccentric. Boys called him “Dafty,” and used
to try to make fun of him. On one occasion I remember he
turned with tremendous vigour, with a kind of demonic force,
on his tormentors. I think he was let alone after that, and
gradually won the respect even of the most thoughtless of his
schoolfellows.’”</p>
</div>

<p>The first reference to mathematical studies occurs,
says Professor Campbell, in a letter to his father
written soon after his thirteenth birthday.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“After describing the Virginian Minstrels, and betwixt
inquiries after various pets at Glenlair, he remarks, as if it
were an ordinary piece of news, ‘I have made a tetrahedron,
a dodecahedron, and two other hedrons, whose names I don’t
know.’ We had not yet begun geometry, and he had certainly
not at this time learnt the definitions in Euclid; yet he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
not merely realised the nature of the five regular solids
sufficiently to construct them out of pasteboard with approximate
accuracy, but had further contrived other symmetrical
polyhedra derived from them, specimens of which
(as improved in 1848) may be still seen at the Cavendish
Laboratory.</p>

<p>“Who first called his attention to the pyramid, cube, etc., I
do not know. He may have seen an account of them by
chance in a book. But the fact remains that at this early time
his fancy, like that of the old Greek geometers, was arrested
by these types of complete symmetry; and his imagination so
thoroughly mastered them that he proceeded to make them
with his own hand. That he himself attached more importance
to this moment than the letter indicates is proved by the care
with which he has preserved these perishable things, so that
they (or those which replaced them in 1848) are still in
existence after thirty-seven years.”</p>
</div>

<p>The summer holidays were spent at Glenlair.
His cousin, Miss Jemima Wedderburn, was with him,
and shared his play. Her skilled pencil has left us
many amusing pictures of the time, some of which
are reproduced by Professor Campbell. There were
expeditions and picnics of all sorts, and a new toy
known as “the devil on two sticks” afforded infinite
amusement. The winter holidays usually found him
at Penicuik, or occasionally at Glasgow, with Professor
Blackburne or Professor W. Thomson (now Lord
Kelvin). In October, 1844, Maxwell was promoted
to the rector’s class-room. John Williams, afterwards
Archdeacon of Cardigan, a distinguished Baliol man,
was rector, and the change was in many ways an
important one for Maxwell. He writes to his father:
“I like P—— better than B——. We have lots of
jokes, and he speaks a great deal, and we have not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
so much monotonous parsing. In the English Milton
is better than the History of Greece....”</p>

<p>P—— was the boys’ nickname for the rector;
B—— for Mr. Carmichael, the second master. This<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a>
is the account of Maxwell’s first interview with the
<span class="locked">rector:—</span></p>

<p><i>Rector</i>: “What part of Galloway do you come
from?”</p>

<p><i>J. C. M.</i>: “From the Vale of Urr. Ye spell it
o, err, err, or oo, err, err.”</p>

<p>The study of geometry was begun, and in the
mathematical master, Mr. Gloag, Maxwell found a
teacher with a real gift for his task. It was here
that Maxwell’s vast superiority to many who were
his companions at once showed itself. “He seemed,”
says Professor Campbell, “to be in the heart of the
subject when they were only at the boundary; but the
boyish game of contesting point by point with such
a mind was a most wholesome stimulus, so that the
mere exercise of faculty was a pure joy. With
Maxwell the first lessons of geometry branched out
at once into inquiries which became fruitful.”</p>

<p>In July, 1845, he <span class="locked">writes:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have got the 11th prize for Scholarship, the 1st for
English, the prize for English verses, and the Mathematical
Medal. I tried for Scripture knowledge, and Hamilton in the
7th has got it. We tried for the Medal on Thursday. I had
done them all, and got home at half-past two; but Campbell
stayed till four. I was rather tired with writing exercises
from nine till half-past two.</p>

<p>“Campbell and I went ‘once more unto the b(r)each’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
to-day at Portobello. I can swim a little now. Campbell has
got 6 prizes. He got a letter written too soon, congratulating
him upon <em>my</em> medal; but there is no rivalry betwixt us, as
B—— Carmichael says.”</p>
</div>

<p>After a summer spent chiefly at Glenlair, he
returned with his father to Edinburgh for the winter,
and began, at the age of fourteen, to go to the
meetings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. At
the Society of Arts he met Mr. R. D. Hay, the
decorative painter, who had interested himself in the
attempt to reduce beauty in form and colour to
mathematical principles. Clerk Maxwell was interested
in the question how to draw a perfect oval,
and devised a method of drawing oval curves which
was referred by his father to Professor Forbes for
his criticism and suggestions. After discussing the
matter with Professor Kelland, Professor Forbes
wrote as <span class="locked">follows<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a>:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>,—I am glad to find to-day, from Professor
Kelland, that his opinion of your son’s paper agrees with mine,
namely, that it is most ingenious, most creditable to him, and,
we believe, a new way of considering higher curves with
reference to foci. Unfortunately, these ovals appear to be
curves of a very high and intractable order, so that possibly
the elegant method of description may not lead to a corresponding
simplicity in investigating their properties. But that
is not the present point. If you wish it, I think that the
simplicity and elegance of the method would entitle it to be
brought before the Royal Society.—Believe me, my dear sir,
yours truly,</p>

<p class="sigright">
“<span class="smcap">James D. Forbes</span>.”
</p>
</div>

<p>In consequence of this, Clerk Maxwell’s first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
published paper was communicated to the Royal
Society of Edinburgh on April 6th, 1846, when its
author was barely fifteen. Its title is as follows:
“On the Description of Oval Curves and those having
a Plurality of Foci. By Mr. Clerk Maxwell, Junior.
With Remarks by Professor Forbes. Communicated
by Professor Forbes.”</p>

<p>The notice in his father’s diary runs: “M. 6 [Ap.,
1846.] Royal Society with Jas. Professor Forbes
gave acct. of James’s Ovals. Met with very great
attention and approbation generally.”</p>

<p>This was the beginning of the lifelong friendship
between Maxwell and Forbes.</p>

<p>The curves investigated by Maxwell have the
property that the sum found by adding to the
distance of any point on the curve from one focus
a constant multiple of the distance of the same point
from a second focus is always constant.</p>

<p>The curves are of great importance in the
theory of light, for if this constant factor expresses
the refractive index of any medium, then
light diverging from one focus without the medium
and refracted at a surface bounding the medium, and
having the form of one of Maxwell’s ovals, will be
refracted so as to converge to the second focus.</p>

<p>About the same time he was busy with some
investigations on the properties of jelly and gutta-percha,
which seem to have been suggested by Forbes’
“Theory of Glaciers.”</p>

<p>He failed to obtain the Mathematical Medal in
1846—possibly on account of these researches—but
he continued at school till 1847, when he left, being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
then first in mathematics and in English, and nearly
first in Latin.</p>

<p>In 1847 he was working at magnetism and the
polarisation of light. Some time in that year he was
taken by his uncle, Mr. John Cay, to see William
Nicol, the inventor of the polarising prism, who
showed him the colours exhibited by polarised light
after passing through unannealed glass. On his
return, he made a polariscope with a glass reflector.
The framework of the first instrument was of cardboard,
but a superior article was afterwards constructed
of wood. Small lenses mounted on cardboard were
employed when a conical pencil was needed. By
means of this instrument he examined the figures
exhibited by pieces of unannealed glass, which he
prepared himself; and, with a camera lucida and box
of colours, he reproduced these figures on paper,
taking care to sketch no outlines, but to shade each
coloured band imperceptibly into the next. Some of
these coloured drawings he forwarded to Nicol, and
was more than repaid by the receipt shortly afterwards
of a pair of prisms prepared by Nicol himself.
These prisms were always very highly prized by
Maxwell. Once, when at Trinity, the little box
containing them was carried off by his bed-maker
during a vacation, and destined for destruction. The
bed-maker died before term commenced, and it was
only by diligent search among her effects that the
prisms were recovered.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> After this they were more
carefully guarded, and they are now, together with
the wooden polariscope, the bits of unannealed glass,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
and the water-colour drawings, in one of the showcases
at the Cavendish Laboratory.</p>

<p>About this time, Professor P. G. Tait and he were
schoolfellows at the Academy, acknowledged as the
two best mathematicians in the school. It was
thought desirable, says Professor Campbell, that “we
should have lessons in physical science, so one of the
classical masters gave them out of a text-book....
The only thing I distinctly remember about these
hours is that Maxwell and P. G. Tait seemed to know
much more about the subject than our teacher did.”</p>

<p>An interesting account of these days is given by
Professor Tait in an obituary notice on Maxwell
printed in the “Proceedings of the Royal Society of
Edinburgh, 1879–80,” from which the following is
<span class="locked">taken:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“When I first made Clerk Maxwell’s acquaintance, about
thirty-five years ago, at the Edinburgh Academy, he was a
year before me, being in the fifth class, while I was in the
fourth.</p>

<p>“At school he was at first regarded as shy and rather dull.
He made no friendships, and he spent his occasional holidays
in reading old ballads, drawing curious diagrams, and making
rude mechanical models. This absorption in such pursuits,
totally unintelligible to his schoolfellows (who were then quite
innocent of mathematics), of course procured him a not very
complimentary nickname, which I know is still remembered
by many Fellows of this Society. About the middle of his
school career, however, he surprised his companions by
suddenly becoming one of the most brilliant among them,
gaining high, and sometimes the highest, prizes for scholarships,
mathematics, and English verse composition. From
this time forward I became very intimate with him, and we
discussed together, with schoolboy enthusiasm, numerous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
curious problems, among which I remember particularly the
various plane sections of a ring or tore, and the form of a
cylindrical mirror which should show one his own image
unperverted. I still possess some of the MSS. we exchanged
in 1846 and early in 1847. Those by Maxwell are on ‘The
Conical Pendulum,’ ‘Descartes’ Ovals,’ ‘Meloid and Apioid,’
and ‘Trifocal Curves.’ All are drawn up in strict geometrical
form and divided into consecutive propositions. The three
latter are connected with his first published paper, communicated
by Forbes to this society and printed in our ‘Proceedings,’
vol. ii., under the title, ‘On the Description of Oval
Curves and those having a Plurality of Foci’ (1846). At the
time when these papers were written he had received no
instruction in mathematics beyond a few books of Euclid and
the merest elements of algebra.”</p>
</div>

<p>In November, 1847, Clerk Maxwell entered the
University of Edinburgh, learning mathematics from
Kelland, natural philosophy from J. D. Forbes, and
logic from Sir W. R. Hamilton. At this time, according
to Professor <span class="locked">Campbell<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a>—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="in0">“he still occasioned some concern to the more conventional
amongst his friends by the originality and simplicity of
his ways. His replies in ordinary conversation were indirect
and enigmatical, often uttered with hesitation and in a
monotonous key. While extremely neat in his person, he had
a rooted objection to the vanities of starch and gloves. He
had a pious horror of destroying anything, even a scrap of
writing-paper. He preferred travelling by the third class in
railway journeys, saying he liked a hard seat. When at table
he often seemed abstracted from what was going on, being
absorbed in observing the effects of refracted light in the
finger-glasses, or in trying some experiment with his eyes—seeing
round a corner, making invisible stereoscopes, and the
like. Miss Cay used to call his attention by crying, ‘Jamsie,
you’re in a prop.’ He never tasted wine; and he spoke to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
gentle and simple in exactly the same tone. On the other
hand, his teachers—Forbes above all—had formed the highest
opinion of his intellectual originality and force; and a few
experienced observers, in watching his devotion to his father,
began to have some inkling of his heroic singleness of heart.
To his college companions, whom he could now select at will,
his quaint humour was an endless delight. His chief associates,
after I went to the University of Glasgow, were my brother,
Robert Campbell (still at the Academy), P. G. Tait, and Allan
Stewart. Tait went to Peterhouse, Cambridge, in 1848, after
one session of the University of Edinburgh; Stewart to the
same college in 1849; Maxwell did not go up until 1850.”</p>
</div>

<p>During this period he wrote two important papers.
The one, on “Rolling Curves,” was read to the
Royal Society of Edinburgh by Professor Kelland—(“it
was not thought proper for a boy in a round
jacket to mount the rostrum”)—in February, 1849;
the other, on “The Equilibrium of Elastic Solids,”
appeared in the spring of 1850.</p>

<p>The vacations were spent at Glenlair, and we learn
from letters to Professor Campbell and others how
the time was passed.</p>

<p>“On Saturday,” he writes<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a>—April 26th, 1848, just
after his arrival home—“the natural philosophers
ran up Arthur’s Seat with the barometer. The
Professor set it down at the top.... He did not
set it straight, and made the hill grow fifty feet; but
we got it down again.”</p>

<p>In a letter of July in the same year he describes
his <span class="locked">laboratory:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have regularly set up shop now above the wash-house
at the gate, in a garret. I have an old door set on two barrels,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
and two chairs, of which one is safe, and a skylight above
which will slide up and down.</p>

<p>“On the door (or table) there is a lot of bowls, jugs,
plates, jam pigs, etc., containing water, salt, soda, sulphuric
acid, blue vitriol, plumbago ore; also broken glass, iron, and
copper wire, copper and zinc plate, bees’ wax, sealing wax,
clay, rosin, charcoal, a lens, a Smee’s galvanic apparatus, and
a countless variety of little beetles, spiders, and wood lice,
which fall into the different liquids and poison themselves. I
intend to get up some more galvanism in jam pigs; but I
must first copper the interiors of the pigs, so I am experimenting
on the best methods of electrotyping. So I am making
copper seals with the device of a beetle. First, I thought a
beetle was a good conductor, so I embedded one in wax (not
at all cruel, because I slew him in boiling water, in which he
never kicked), leaving his back out; but he would not do.
Then I took a cast of him in sealing wax, and pressed wax
into the hollow, and blackleaded it with a brush; but neither
would that do. So at last I took my fingers and rubbed it,
which I find the best way to use the blacklead. Then it
coppered famously. I melt out the wax with the lens, that
being the cleanest way of getting a strong heat, so I do most
things with it that need heat. To-day I astonished the
natives as follows. I took a crystal of blue vitriol and put
the lens to it, and so drove off the water, leaving a white
powder. Then I did the same to some washing soda, and
mixed the two white powders together, and made a small
native spit on them, which turned them green by a mutual
exchange, thus:—1. Sulphate of copper and carbonate of soda.
2. Sulphate of soda and carbonate of copper (blue or green).”</p>
</div>

<p>Of his reading he says:—“I am reading Herodotus’
‘Euterpe,’ having taken the turn—that is to say that
sometimes I can do props., read Diff. and Int. Calc.,
Poisson, Hamilton’s dissertation, etc.”</p>

<p>In September he was busy with polarised light.
“We were at Castle Douglas yesterday, and got<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
crystals of saltpetre, which I have been cutting up
into plates to-day in hopes to see rings.”</p>

<p>In July, 1849, he <span class="locked">writes<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a>:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have set up the machine for showing the rings in
crystals, which I planned during your visit last year. It
answers very well. I also made some experiments on compressed
jellies in illustration of my props. on that subject.
The principal one was this:—The jelly is poured while hot
into the annular space contained between a paper cylinder and
a cork; then, when cold, the cork is twisted round and the
jelly exposed to polarised light, when a transverse cross, <span class="sans smaller">x</span>,
not +, appears, with rings as the inverse square of the radius,
all which is fully verified. Hip! etc. <i>Q.E.D.</i>”</p>
</div>

<p class="in0">And again on March 22nd, <span class="locked">1850:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“At Practical Mechanics I have been turning Devils of
sorts. For private studies I have been reading Young’s
‘Lectures,’ Willis’s ‘Principles of Mechanism,’ Moseley’s
‘Engineering and Mechanics,’ Dixon on ‘Heat,’ and Moigno’s
‘Répertoire d’Optique.’ This last is a very complete analysis
of all that has been done in the optical way from Fresnel to
the end of 1849, and there is another volume a-coming which
will complete the work. There is in it, besides common optics,
all about the other things which accompany light, as heat,
chemical action, photographic rays, action on vegetables, etc.</p>

<p>“My notions are rather few, as I do not <em>entertain</em> them
just now. I have a notion for the torsion of wires and rods,
not to be made till the vacation; of experiments on the action
of compression on glass, jelly, etc., numerically done up; of
papers for the Physico-Mathematical Society (which is to
revive in earnest next session!); on the relations of optical
and mechanical constants, their desirableness, etc.; and suspension
bridges, and catenaries, and elastic curves. Alex.
Campbell, Agnew, and I are appointed to read up the subject
of periodical shooting stars, and to prepare a list of the
phenomena to be observed on the 9th August and 13th<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
November. The society’s barometer is to be taken up Arthur’s
Seat at the end of the session, when Forbes goes up, and All
students are invited to attend, so that the existence of the
society may be recognised.”</p>
</div>

<p>It was at last settled that he was to go up to
Cambridge. Tait had been at Peterhouse for two
years, while Allan Stewart had joined him there in
1849, and after much discussion it was arranged that
Maxwell should enter at the same college.</p>

<p>Of this period of his life Tait writes as <span class="locked">follows:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The winter of 1847 found us together in the classes of
Forbes and Kelland, where he highly distinguished himself.
With the former he was a particular favourite, being admitted
to the free use of the class apparatus for original experiments.
He lingered here behind most of his former associates, having
spent three years at the University of Edinburgh, working
(without any assistance or supervision) with physical and
chemical apparatus, and devouring all sorts of scientific works
in the library. During this period he wrote two valuable
papers, which are published in our ‘Transactions,’ on ‘The
Theory of Rolling Curves’ and on ‘The Equilibrium of Elastic
Solids.’ Thus he brought to Cambridge, in the autumn of
1850, a mass of knowledge which was really immense for so
young a man, but in a state of disorder appalling to his
methodical private tutor. Though that tutor was William
Hopkins, the pupil to a great extent took his own way, and it
may safely be said that no high wrangler of recent years ever
entered the Senate House more imperfectly trained to produce
‘paying’ work than did Clerk Maxwell. But by sheer strength
of intellect, though with the very minimum of knowledge how
to use it to advantage under the conditions of the examination,
he obtained the position of Second Wrangler, and was
bracketed equal with the Senior Wrangler in the higher ordeal
of the Smith’s Prizes. His name appears in the Cambridge
‘Calendar’ as Maxwell of Trinity, but he was originally
entered at Peterhouse, and kept his first term there, in that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
small but most ancient foundation which has of late furnished
Scotland with the majority of the professors of mathematics
and natural philosophy in her four universities.”</p>
</div>

<p class="in0">While W. D. Niven, in his preface to Maxwell’s
collected works (p. xii.), <span class="locked">says:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It may readily be supposed that his preparatory training
for the Cambridge course was far removed from the ordinary
type. There had indeed for some time been practically no
restraint upon his plan of study, and his mind had been
allowed to follow its natural bent towards science, though not
to an extent so absorbing as to withdraw him from other
pursuits. Though he was not a sportsman—indeed, sport so-called
was always repugnant to him—he was yet exceedingly
fond of a country life. He was a good horseman and a good
swimmer. Whence, however, he derived his chief enjoyment
may be gathered from the account which Mr. Campbell gives
of the zest with which he quoted on one occasion the lines of
Burns which describe the poet finding inspiration while
wandering along the banks of a stream in the free indulgence
of his fancies. Maxwell was not only a lover of poetry, but
himself a poet, as the fine pieces gathered together by Mr.
Campbell abundantly testify. He saw, however, that his true
calling was science, and never regarded these poetical efforts
as other than mere pastime. Devotion to science, already
stimulated by successful endeavour; a tendency to ponder
over philosophical problems; and an attachment to English
literature, particularly to English poetry—these tastes, implanted
in a mind of singular strength and purity, may be said
to have been the endowments with which young Maxwell
began his Cambridge career. Besides this, his scientific
reading, as we may gather from his papers to the Royal
Society of Edinburgh referred to above, was already extensive
and varied. He brought with him, says Professor Tait, a mass
of knowledge which was really immense for so young a man,
but in a state of disorder appalling to his methodical private
tutor.”</p>

<span class="subhead">UNDERGRADUATE LIFE AT CAMBRIDGE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Maxwell</span> did not remain long at Peterhouse; before
the end of his first term he migrated to Trinity, and
was entered under Dr. Thompson December 14th,
1850. He appeared to the tutor a shy and diffident
youth, but presently surprised Dr. Thompson by
producing a bundle of papers—copies, probably, of
those he had already published—and remarking,
“Perhaps these may show that I am not unfit to
enter at your College.”</p>

<p>The change was pressed upon him by many
friends, the grounds of the advice being that, from
the large number of high wranglers recently at
Peterhouse and the smallness of the foundation, the
chances of a Fellowship there for a mathematical
man were less than at Trinity. It was a step he
never regretted; the prospect of a Fellowship had
but little influence on his mind. He found, however,
at the larger college ampler opportunities for self-improvement,
and it was possible for him to select his
friends from among men whom he otherwise would
never have known.</p>

<p>The record of his undergraduate life is not very
full; his letters to his father have, unfortunately,
been lost, but we have enough in the recollections of
friends still living to picture what it was like. At
first he lodged in King’s Parade with an old Edinburgh
schoolfellow, C. H. Robertson. He attended the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
College lectures on mathematics, though they were
somewhat elementary, and worked as a private pupil
with Porter, of Peterhouse. His father writes to him,
November, 1850: “Have you called on Professors
Sedgwick, at Trin., and Stokes, at Pembroke? If
not, you should do both. Stokes will be most in your
line, if he takes you in hand at all. Sedgwick is also
a great Don in his line, and, if you were entered in
geology, would be a most valuable acquaintance.”</p>

<p>In his second year he became a pupil of Hopkins,
the great coach; he also attended Stokes’ lectures,
and the friendship which lasted till his death was
thus begun. In April, 1852, he was elected a scholar,
and obtained rooms in College (G, Old Court). In
June, 1852, he came of age. “I trust you will be as
discreet when major as you have been while minor,”
writes his father the day before. The next academic
year, October, 1852, to June, 1853, was a very busy
one; hard grind for the Tripos occupied his time, and
he seems to have been thoroughly overstrained. He
was taken ill while staying near Lowestoft with the
Rev. C. B. Tayler, the uncle of a College friend. His
own account of the illness is given in a letter to
Professor Campbell<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a>, dated July 14th, 1853.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“You wrote just in time for your letter to reach me as I
reached Cambridge. After examination, I went to visit the
Rev. C. B. Tayler (uncle to a Tayler whom I think you have
seen under the name of <em>Freshman</em>, etc., and author of many
tracts and other didactic works). We had little expedites and
walks, and things parochial and educational, and domesticity.
I intended to return on the 18th June, but on the 17th I felt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
unwell, and took measures accordingly to be well again—<i>i.e.</i>
went to bed, and made up my mind to recover. But it lasted
more than a fortnight, during which time I was taken care of
beyond expectation (not that I did not expect much before).
When I was perfectly useless and could not sit up without
fainting, Mr. Tayler did everything for me in such a way that
I had no fear of giving trouble. So did Mrs. Tayler; and the
two nephews did all they could. So they kept me in great
happiness all the time, and detained me till I was able to walk
about and got back strength. I returned on the 4th July.</p>

<p>“The consequence of all this is that I correspond with Mr.
Tayler, and have entered into bonds with the nephews, of
all of whom more hereafter. Since I came here I have been
attending Hop., but, with his approval, did not begin full
swing. I am getting on, though, and the work is not grinding
on the prepared brain.”</p>
</div>

<p>During this period he wrote some papers for the
<i>Cambridge and Dublin Mathematical Journal</i> which
will be referred to again later. He was also a member
of a discussion society known as the “Apostles,” and
some of the essays contributed by him are preserved
by Professor Campbell. Mr. Niven, in his preface to
the collected edition of Maxwell’s works, suggests
that the composition of these essays laid the foundation
of that literary finish which is one of the
characteristics of Maxwell’s scientific writings.</p>

<p>Among his friends at the time were Tait, Charles
Mackenzie of Caius, the missionary bishop of Central
Africa, Henry and Frank Mackenzie of Trinity,
Droop, third Wrangler in 1854; Gedge, Isaac Taylor,
Blakiston, F. W. Farrar,<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> H. M. Butler,<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> Hort, V.
Lushington, Cecil Munro, G. W. H. Tayler, and W. N.
Lawson. Some of these who survived him have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
given to Professor Campbell their recollections of
these undergraduate days, which are full of interest.</p>

<p>Thus Mr. Lawson <span class="locked">writes<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a>:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“There must be many of his quaint verses about, if one
could lay hands on them, for Maxwell was constantly producing
something of the sort and bringing it round to his friends,
with a sly chuckle at the humour, which, though his own, no
one enjoyed more than himself.</p>

<p>“I remember Maxwell coming to me one morning with a
copy of verses beginning, ‘Gin a body meet a body going
through the air,’ in which he had twisted the well-known song
into a description of the laws of impact of solid bodies.</p>

<p>“There was also a description which Maxwell wrote of
some University ceremony—I forget what—in which somebody
‘went before’ and somebody ‘followed after,’ and ‘in the
midst were the wranglers, playing with the symbols.’</p>

<p>“These last words, however meant, were, in fact, a description
of his own wonderful power. I remember, one day in
lecture, our lecturer had filled the black-board three times
with the investigation of some hard problem in Geometry of
Three Dimensions, and was not at the end of it, when Maxwell
came up with a question whether it would not come out
geometrically, and showed how, with a figure, and in a few
lines, there was the solution at once.</p>

<p>“Maxwell was, I daresay you remember, very fond of a
talk upon almost anything. He and I were pupils (at an
enormous distance apart) of Hopkins, and I well recollect how,
when I had been working the night before and all the morning
at Hopkins’s problems, with little or no result, Maxwell would
come in for a gossip, and talk on while I was wishing him far
away, till at last, about half an hour or so before our meeting
at Hopkins’s, he would say, ‘Well, I must go to old Hop.’s
problems’; and, by the time we met there, they were all done.</p>

<p>“I remember Hopkins telling me, when speaking of
Maxwell, either just before or just after his degree, ‘It is not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
possible for that man to think incorrectly on physical subjects’;
and Hopkins, as you know, had had, perhaps, more experience
of mathematical minds than any man of his time.”</p>
</div>

<p>The last clause is part of a quotation from a diary
kept by Mr. Lawson at Cambridge, in which, under
the date July 15th, 1853, he <span class="locked">writes:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“He (Hopkins) was talking to me this evening about
Maxwell. He says he is unquestionably the most extraordinary
man he has met with in the whole range of his
experience; he says it appears impossible for Maxwell to
think incorrectly on physical subjects; that in his analysis,
however, he is far more deficient. He looks upon him as a
great genius with all its eccentricities, and prophesies that
one day he will shine as a light in physical science—a prophecy
in which all his fellow-students strenuously unite.”</p>
</div>

<p>How many who have struggled through the
“Electricity and Magnetism” have realised the
truth of the remark about the correctness of his
physical intuitions and the deficiency at times of
his analysis!</p>

<p>Dr. Butler, a friend of these early days, preached
the University sermon on November 16th, 1879, ten
days after Maxwell’s death, and spoke <span class="locked">thus:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is a solemn thing—even the least thoughtful is touched
by it—when a great intellect passes away into the silence and
we see it no more. Such a loss, such a void, is present, I feel
certain, to many here to-day. It is not often, even in this
great home of thought and knowledge, that so bright a light
is extinguished as that which is now mourned by many illustrious
mourners, here chiefly, but also far beyond this place. I
shall be believed when I say in all simplicity that I wish it had
fallen to some more competent tongue to put into words those
feelings of reverent affection which are, I am persuaded, uppermost
in many hearts on this Sunday. My poor words shall be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
few, but believe me they come from the heart. You know,
brethren, with what an eager pride we follow the fortunes of
those whom we have loved and reverenced in our undergraduate
days. We may see them but seldom, few letters may
pass between us, but their names are never common names.
They never become to us only what other men are. When
I came up to Trinity twenty-eight years ago, James Clerk
Maxwell was just beginning his second year. His position
among us—I speak in the presence of many who remember
that time—was unique. He was the one acknowledged man
of genius among the undergraduates. We understood even
then that, though barely of age, he was in his own line of
inquiry not a beginner but a master. His name was already
a familiar name to men of science. If he lived, it was certain
that he was one of that small but sacred band to whom it
would be given to enlarge the bounds of human knowledge.
It was a position which might have turned the head of a
smaller man; but the friend of whom we were all so proud,
and who seemed, as it were, to link us thus early with the
great outside world of the pioneers of knowledge, had one of
those rich and lavish natures which no prosperity can impoverish,
and which make faith in goodness easy for others. I
have often thought that those who never knew the grand old
Adam Sedgwick and the then young and ever-youthful Clerk
Maxwell had yet to learn the largeness and fulness of the
moulds in which some choice natures are framed. Of the
scientific greatness of our friend we were most of us unable to
judge; but anyone could see and admire the boy-like glee, the
joyous invention, the wide reading, the eager thirst for truth,
the subtle thought, the perfect temper, the unfailing reverence,
the singular absence of any taint of the breath of worldliness
in any of its thousand forms.</p>

<p>“Brethren, you may know such men now among your college
friends, though there can be but few in any year, or indeed in
any century, that possess the rare genius of the man whom we
deplore. If it be so, then, if you will accept the counsel of a
stranger, thank God for His gift. Believe me when I tell you
that few such blessings will come to you in later life. There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
are blessings that come once in a lifetime. One of these is the
reverence with which we look up to greatness and goodness in
a college friend—above us, beyond us, far out of our mental or
moral grasp, but still one of us, near to us, our own. You
know, in part at least, how in this case the promise of youth
was more than fulfilled, and how the man who, but a fortnight
ago, was the ornament of the University, and—shall I be
wrong in saying it?—almost the discoverer of a new world of
knowledge, was even more loved than he was admired, retaining
after twenty years of fame that mirth, that simplicity, that
child-like delight in all that is fresh and wonderful which we
rejoice to think of as some of the surest accompaniment of
true scientific genius.</p>

<p>“You know, also, that he was a devout as well as thoughtful
Christian. I do not note this in the triumphant spirit of a
controversialist. I will not for a moment assume that there is
any natural opposition between scientific genius and simple
Christian faith. I will not compare him with others who have
had the genius without the faith. Christianity, though she
thankfully welcomes and deeply prizes them, does not need
now, any more than when St. Paul first preached the Cross at
Corinth, the speculations of the subtle or the wisdom of the
wise. If I wished to show men, especially young men, the
living force of the Gospel, I would take them not so much to
a learned and devout Christian man to whom all stores of
knowledge were familiar, but to some country village where
for fifty years there had been devout traditions and devout
practice. There they would see the Gospel lived out; truths,
which other men spoke of, seen and known; a spirit not of
this world, visibly, hourly present; citizenship in heaven daily
assumed and daily realised. Such characters I believe to be
the most convincing preachers to those who ask whether
Revelation is a fable and God an unknowable. Yes, in most
cases—not, I admit, in all—simple faith, even peradventure
more than devout genius, is mighty for removing doubts and
implanting fresh conviction. But having said this, we may
well give thanks to God that our friend was what he was, a
firm Christian believer, and that his powerful mind, after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
ranging at will through the illimitable spaces of Creation and
almost handling what he called ‘the foundation-stones of the
material universe,’ found its true rest and happiness in the
love and the mercy of Him whom the humblest Christian calls
his Father. Of such a man it may be truly said that he had
his citizenship in heaven, and that he looked for, as a Saviour,
the Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the unnumbered worlds
were made, and in the likeness of whose image our new and
spiritual body will be fashioned.”</p>
</div>

<p>The Tripos came in January, 1854. “You will
need to get muffetees for the Senate Room. Take
your plaid or rug to wrap round your feet and legs,”
was his father’s advice—advice which will appeal to
many who can remember the Senate House as it felt
on a cold January morning.</p>

<p>Maxwell had been preparing carefully for this
examination. Thus to his aunt, Miss Cay, in June,
1853, he writes:—“If anyone asks how I am getting
on in mathematics, say that I am busy arranging
everything so as to be able to express all distinctly,
so that examiner may be satisfied now and pupils
edified hereafter. It is pleasant work and very
strengthening, but not nearly finished.”</p>

<p>Still, the illness of July, 1853, had left some effect.
Professor Baynes states that he said that on entering
the Senate House for the first paper he felt his mind
almost a blank, but by-and-by his mental vision
became preternaturally clear.</p>

<p>The moderators were Mackenzie of Caius, whose
advice had been mainly instrumental in leading him
to migrate to Trinity, Wm. Walton of Trinity,
Wolstenholme of Christ’s, and Percival Frost of St.
John’s.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span></p>

<p>When the lists were published, Routh of Peterhouse
was senior, Maxwell second. The examination
for the Smith’s Prizes followed in a few days, and
then Routh and Maxwell were declared equal.</p>

<p>In a letter to Miss Cay<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> of January 13th, while
waiting for the three days’ list, he <span class="locked">writes:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“All my correspondents have been writing to me, which is
kind, and have not been writing questions, which is kinder.
So I answer you now, while I am slacking speed to get up
steam, leaving Lewis and Stewart, etc., till next week, when I
will give an account of the <em>five days</em>. There are a good many
up here at present, and we get on very jolly on the whole; but
some are not well, and some are going to be plucked or
gulphed, as the case may be, and others are reading so hard
that they are invisible. I go to-morrow to breakfast with
shaky men, and after food I am to go and hear the list read
out, and whether they are through, and bring them word.
When the honour list comes out the poll men act as messengers.
Bob Campbell comes in occasionally of an evening now, to
discuss matters and vary sports. During examination I have
had men at night working with gutta-percha, magnets, etc.
It is much better than reading novels or talking after 5½
hours’ hard writing.”</p>
</div>

<p>His father, on hearing the news, wrote from
<span class="locked">Edinburgh:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I heartily congratulate you on your place in the list. I
suppose it is higher than the speculators would have guessed,
and quite as high as Hopkins reckoned on. I wish you success
in the Smith’s Prizes; be sure to write me the result. I will
see Mrs. Morrieson, and I think I will call on Dr. Gloag to
congratulate him. He has at least three pupils gaining
honours.”</p>
</div>

<p>His friends in Edinburgh were greatly pleased.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
“I get congratulations on all hands,” his father writes,<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a>
“including Professor Kelland and Sandy Fraser and
all others competent.... To-night or on Monday
I shall expect to hear of the Smith’s Prizes.” And
again, February 6th, 1854:—“George Wedderburn
came into my room at 2 a.m. yesterday morning,
having seen the Saturday <i>Times</i>, received by the
express train.... As you are equal to the
Senior in the champion trial, you are very little
behind him.”</p>

<p>Or again, March 5th, <span class="locked">1854:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Aunt Jane stirred me up to sit for my picture, as she
said you wished for it and were entitled to ask for it <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">qua</i>
Wrangler. I have had four sittings to Sir John Watson
Gordon, and it is now far advanced; I think it is very like.
It is kitcat size, to be a companion to Dyce’s picture of your
mother and self, which Aunt Jane says she is to leave to you.”</p>
</div>

<p>And now the long years of preparation were
nearly over. The cunning craftsman was fitted with
his tools; he could set to work to unlock the secrets
of Nature; he was free to employ his genius and his
knowledge on those tasks for which he felt most
fitted.</p>

<span class="subhead">EARLY RESEARCHES.—PROFESSOR AT ABERDEEN.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">From</span> this time on Maxwell’s life becomes a record
of his writings and discoveries. It will, however,
probably be clearest to separate as far as possible
biographical details from a detailed account of his
scientific work, leaving this for consecutive treatment
in later chapters, and only alluding to it so far as
may prove necessary to explain references in his
letters.</p>

<p>He continued in Cambridge till the Long Vacation
of 1854, reading Mill’s “Logic.” “I am experiencing
the effects of Mill,” he writes, March 25th, 1854, “but
I take him slowly. I do not think him the last of
his kind. I think more is wanted to bring the connexion
of sensation with science to light, and to show
what it is not.” He also read Berkeley on “The
Theory of Vision” and “greatly admired it.”</p>

<p>About the same time he devised an ophthalmoscope.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have made an instrument for seeing into the eye
through the pupil. The difficulty is to throw the light in at
that small hole and look in at the same time; but that
difficulty is overcome, and I can see a large part of the back
of the eye quite distinctly with the image of the candle on it.
People find no inconvenience in being examined, and I have
got dogs to sit quite still and keep their eyes steady. Dogs’
eyes are very beautiful behind—a copper-coloured ground, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
glorious bright patches and networks of blue, yellow, and
green, with blood-vessels great and small.”</p>
</div>

<p>After the vacation he returned to Cambridge, and
the letters refer to the colour-top. Thus to Miss Cay,
November 24th, 1854, p. <span class="locked">208:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have been very busy of late with various things, and
am just beginning to make papers for the examination at
Cheltenham, which I have to conduct about the 11th of
December. I have also to make papers to polish off my pups.
with. I have been spinning colours a great deal, and have got
most accurate results, proving that ordinary people’s eyes are
all made alike, though some are better than others, and that
other people see two colours instead of three; but all those
who do so agree amongst themselves. I have made a triangle
of colours by which you may make out everything.</p>

<p>“If you can find out any people in Edinburgh who do not
see colours (I know the Dicksons don’t), pray drop a hint that
I would like to see them. I have put one here up to a dodge
by which he distinguishes colours without fail. I have also
constructed a pair of squinting spectacles, and am beginning
operations on a squinting man.”</p>
</div>

<p>A paper written for his own use originally some
time in 1854, but communicated as a parting gift to
his friend Farrar, who was about to become a master
at Marlborough, gives us some insight into his view
of life at the age of twenty-three.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“He that would enjoy life and act with freedom must have
the work of the day continually before his eyes. Not yesterday’s
work, lest he fall into despair; nor to-morrow’s, lest he
become a visionary—not that which ends with the day, which
is a worldly work; nor yet that only which remains to eternity,
for by it he cannot shape his actions.</p>

<p>“Happy is the man who can recognise in the work of
to-day a connected portion of the work of life and an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
embodiment of the work of Eternity. The foundations of
his confidence are unchangeable, for he has been made a
partaker of Infinity. He strenuously works out his daily
enterprises because the present is given him for a possession.</p>

<p>“Thus ought Man to be an impersonation of the divine
process of nature, and to show forth the union of the infinite
with the finite, not slighting his temporal existence, remembering
that in it only is individual action possible; nor yet
shutting out from his view that which is eternal, knowing that
Time is a mystery which man cannot endure to contemplate
until eternal Truth enlighten it.”</p>
</div>

<p>His father was unwell in the Christmas vacation
of that year, and he could not return to Cambridge at
the beginning of the Lent term. “My steps,” he
writes<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> to C. J. Munro from Edinburgh, February 19th,
1855, “will be no more by the reedy and crooked
till Easter term.... I should like to know how
many kept bacalaurean weeks go to each of these
terms, and when they begin and end. Overhaul the
Calendar, and when found make note of.”</p>

<p>He was back in Cambridge for the May term,
working at the motion of fluids and at his colour-top.
A paper on “Experiments on Colour as Perceived by
the Eye” was communicated to the Royal Society of
Edinburgh on March 19th, 1855. The experiments
were shown to the Cambridge Philosophical Society
in May following, and the results are thus described
in two letters<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> to his father, Saturday, May 5th, 1855:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Royal Society have been very considerate in sending
me my paper on ‘Colours’ just when I wanted it for the
Philosophical here. I am to let them see the tricks on Monday<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
evening, and I have been there preparing their experiments in
the gaslight. There is to be a meeting in my rooms to-night
to discuss Adam Smith’s ‘Theory of Moral Sentiments,’ so I
must clear up my litter presently. I am working away at
electricity again, and have been working my way into the
views of heavy German writers. It takes a long time to
reduce to order all the notions one gets from these men, but
I hope to see my way through the subject and arrive at something
intelligible in the way of a theory....</p>

<p>“The colour trick came off on Monday, 7th. I had the
proof-sheets of my paper, and was going to read; but I
changed my mind and talked instead, which was more to the
purpose. There were sundry men who thought that blue and
yellow make green, so I had to undeceive them. I have got
Hay’s book of colours out of the Univ. Library, and am
working through the specimens, matching them with the top.
I have a new trick of stretching the string horizontally above
the top, so as to touch the upper part of the axis. The motion
of the axis sets the string a-vibrating in the same time with
the revolutions of the top, and the colours are seen in the haze
produced by the vibration. Thomson has been spinning the
top, and he finds my diagram of colours agrees with his
experiments, but he doubts about browns, what is their
composition. I have got colcothar brown, and can make white
with it, and blue and green; also, by mixing red with a little
blue and green and a great deal of black, I can match colcothar
exactly.</p>

<p>“I have been perfecting my instrument for looking into
the eye. Ware has a little beast like old Ask, which sits quite
steady and seems to like being looked at, and I have got
several men who have large pupils and do not wish to let me
look in. I have seen the image of the candle distinctly in all
the eyes I have tried, and the veins of the retina were visible
in some; but the dogs’ eyes showed all the ramifications of
veins, with glorious blue and green network, so that you might
copy down everything. I have shown lots of men the image
in my own eye by shutting off the light till the pupil dilated
and then letting it on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span></p>

<p>“I am reading Electricity and working at Fluid Motion,
and have got out the condition of a fluid being able to flow
the same way for a length of time and not wriggle about.”</p>
</div>

<p>The British Association met at Glasgow in September,
1855, and Maxwell was present, and showed
his colour-top at Professor Ramsay’s house to some of
those interested. Letters<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> to his father about this
time describe some of the events of the meeting and
his own plans for the term.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We had a paper from Brewster on ‘The theory of three
colours in the spectrum,’ in which he treated Whewell with
philosophic pity, commending him to the care of Prof. Wartman
of Geneva, who was considered the greatest authority in
cases of his kind—cases, in fact, of colour-blindness. Whewell
was in the room, but went out and avoided the quarrel; and
Stokes made a few remarks, stating the case not only clearly
but courteously. However, Brewster did not seem to see that
Stokes admitted his experiments to be correct, and the newspapers
represented Stokes as calling in question the accuracy
of the experiments.</p>

<p>“I am getting my electrical mathematics into shape, and I
see through some parts which were rather hazy before; but I
do not find very much time for it at present, because I am
reading about heat and fluids, so as not to tell lies in my
lectures. I got a note from the Society of Arts about the
platometer, awarding thanks and offering to defray the expenses
to the extent of £10, on the machine being produced in
working order. When I have arranged it in my head, I intend
to write to James Bryson about it.</p>

<p>“I got a long letter from Thomson about colours and
electricity. He is beginning to believe in my theory about all
colours being capable of reference to three standard ones, and
he is very glad that I should poach on his electrical preserves.</p>

<p>“... It is difficult to keep up one’s interest in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
intellectual matters when friends of the intellectual kind are
scarce. However, there are plenty friends not intellectual
who serve to bring out the active and practical habits of mind,
which overly-intellectual people seldom do. Wherefore, if I
am to be up this term, I intend to addict myself rather to the
working men who are getting up classes than to pups., who
are in the main a vexation. Meanwhile, there is the examination
to consider.</p>

<p>“You say Dr. Wilson has sent his book. I will write and
thank him. I suppose it is about colour-blindness. I intend
to begin Poisson’s papers on electricity and magnetism to-morrow.
I have got them out of the library. My reading
hitherto has been of novels—‘Shirley’ and ‘The Newcomes,’
and now ‘Westward Ho.’</p>

<p>“Macmillan proposes to get up a book of optics with my
assistance, and I feel inclined for the job. There is great
bother in making a mathematical book, especially on a subject
with which you are familiar, for in correcting it you do as you
would to pups.—look if the principle and result is right, and
forget to look out for small errors in the course of the work.
However, I expect the work will be salutary, as involving
hard work, and in the end much abuse from coaches and
students, and certainly no vain fame, except in Macmillan’s
puffs. But, if I have rightly conceived the plan of an
educational book on optics, it will be very different in manner,
though not in matter, from those now used.”</p>
</div>

<p>The examination referred to was that for a
Fellowship at Trinity, and Maxwell was elected on
October 10th, 1855.</p>

<p>He was immediately asked to lecture for the
College, on hydrostatics and optics, to the upper
division of the third year, and to set papers for the
questionists. In consequence, he declined to take
pupils, in order to have time for reading and doing
private mathematics, and for seeing the men who
attended his lectures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span></p>

<p>In November he writes: “I have been lecturing
two weeks now, and the class seems improving; and
they come and ask questions, which is a good sign.
I have been making curves to show the relations of
pressure and volume in gases, and they make the
subject easier.”</p>

<p>Still, he found time to attend Professor Willis’s
lectures on mechanism and to continue his reading.
“I have been reading,” he writes, “old books on
optics, and find many things in them far better than
what is new. The foreign mathematicians are discovering
for themselves methods which were well
known at Cambridge in 1720, but are now forgotten.”</p>

<p>The “Poisson” was read to help him with his
own views on electricity, which were rapidly maturing,
and the first of that great series of works which has
revolutionised the science was published on December
10th, 1855, when his paper on “Faraday’s Lines of
Force” was read to the Cambridge Philosophical
Society.</p>

<p>The next term found him back in Cambridge at
work on his lectures, full of plans for a new colour
top and other matters. Early in February he received
a letter from Professor Forbes, telling him that the
Professorship of Natural Philosophy in Marischal
College, Aberdeen, was vacant, and suggesting that
he should apply.</p>

<p>He decided to be a candidate if his father
approved. “For my own part,” he writes, “I think
the sooner I get into regular work the better, and
that the best way of getting into such work is to
profess one’s readiness by applying for it.” On the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
20th of February he writes: “However, wisdom is of
many kinds, and I do not know which dwells with
wise counsellors most, whether scientific, practical,
political, or ecclesiastical. I hear there are candidates
of all kinds relying on the predominance of one or
other of these kinds of wisdom in the constitution of
the Government.”</p>

<p>The second part of the paper on “Faraday’s Lines
of Force” was read during the term. Writing on the
4th of March, he expresses the hope soon to be able
to write out fully the paper. “I have done nothing
in that way this term,” he says, “but am just beginning
to feel the electrical state come on again.”</p>

<p>His father was working at Edinburgh in support
of his candidature for Aberdeen, and when, in the
middle of March, he returned North, he found everything
well prepared. The two returned to Glenlair
together after a few days in Edinburgh, and Maxwell
was preparing to go back to Cambridge, when, on the
2nd of April, his father died suddenly.</p>

<p>Writing to Mrs. Blackburn, he says: “My father
died suddenly to-day at twelve o’clock. He had been
giving directions about the garden, and he said he
would sit down and rest a little, as usual. After a
few minutes I asked him to lie down on the sofa, and
he did not seem inclined to do so; and then I got
him some ether, which had helped him before.
Before he could take any he had a slight struggle,
and all was over. He hardly breathed afterwards.”</p>

<p>Almost immediately after this, Maxwell was
appointed to Aberdeen. His father’s death had
frustrated some at least of the intentions with which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
he had applied for the post. He knew the old man
would be glad to see him the occupant of a Scotch
chair. He hoped, too, to be able to live with his
father at Glenlair for one half the year; but this was
not to be. No doubt the laboratory and the freedom
of the post, when compared with the routine work
of preparing men for the Tripos, had their inducements;
still, it may be doubted if the choice was
a wise one for him. The work of drilling classes,
composed, for the most part, of raw untrained lads,
in the elements of physics and mechanics was, as
Niven says in his preface to the collected works, not
that for which he was best fitted; while at Cambridge,
had he stayed, he must always have had among his
pupils some of the best mathematicians of the time;
and he might have founded some ten or fifteen years
before he did that Cambridge School of Physicists
which looks back with so much pride to him as their
master.</p>

<p>Leave-taking at Trinity was a sad task. He
writes<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> thus, June 4th, to Mr. R. B. <span class="locked">Litchfield:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“On Thursday evening I take the North-Western route to
the North. I am busy looking over immense rubbish of
papers, etc., for some things not to be burnt lie among much
combustible matter, and some is soft and good for packing.</p>

<p>“It is not pleasant to go down to live solitary, but it would
not be pleasant to stay up either, when all one had to do lay
elsewhere. The transition state from a man into a Don must
come at last, and it must be painful, like gradual outrooting of
nerves. When it is done there is no more pain, but occasional
reminders from some suckers, tap-roots, or other remnants of
the old nerves, just to show what was there and what might
have been.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span></p>

<p>The summer of 1856 was spent at Glenlair,
where various friends were his guests—Lushington,
MacLennan, the two cousins Cay, and others. He
continued to work at optics, electricity, and magnetism,
and in October was busy with “a solemn address or
manifesto to the Natural Philosophers of the North,
which needed coffee and anchovies and a roaring hot
fire and spread coat-tails to make it natural.” This
was his inaugural lecture.</p>

<p>In November he was at Aberdeen. Letters<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> to
Miss Cay, Professor Campbell, and C. J. Munro tell
of the work of the session. The last is from Glenlair,
dated May 20th, 1857, after work was over.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The session went off smoothly enough. I had Sun, all
the beginning of optics, and worked off all the experimental
part up to Fraunhofer’s lines, which were glorious to see with
a water-prism I have set up in the form of a cubical box, five
inch side....</p>

<p>“I succeeded very well with heat. The experiments on
latent heat came out very accurate. That was my part, and
the class could explain and work out the results better than I
expected. Next year I intend to mix experimental physics with
mechanics, devoting Tuesday and THURSDAY (what would
Stokes say?) to the science of experimenting accurately....</p>

<p>“Last week I brewed chlorophyll (as the chemists word it),
a green liquor, which turns the invisible light red....</p>

<p>“My last grind was the reduction of equations of colour
which I made last year. The result was eminently satisfactory.”</p>
</div>

<p>Another letter,<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> June 5th, 1857, also to Munro,
refers to the work of the University Commission and
the new statutes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have not seen Article 7, but I agree with your dissent
from it entirely. On the vested interest principle, I think the
men who intended to keep their fellowships by celibacy and
ordination, and got them on that footing, should not be
allowed to desert the virgin choir or neglect the priestly
office, but on those principles should be allowed to live out
their days, provided the whole amount of souls cured annually
does not amount to £20 in the King’s Book. But my doctrine
is that the various grades of College officers should be set on
such a basis that, although chance lecturers might be sometimes
chosen from among fresh fellows who are going away
soon, the reliable assistant tutors, and those that have a plain
calling that way, should, after a few years, be elected permanent
officers of the College, and be tutors and deans in their time,
and seniors also, with leave to marry, or, rather, never prohibited
or asked any questions on that head, and with leave to
retire after so many years’ service as seniors. As for the men
of the world, we should have a limited term of existence, and
that independent of marriage or ‘parsonage.’”</p>
</div>

<p>It was more than twenty years before the scheme
outlined in the above letter came to anything; but,
at the time of Maxwell’s death in 1879, another
Commission was sitting, and the plan suggested by
Maxwell became the basis of the statutes of nearly
all the colleges.</p>

<p>For the winter session of 1857–58 he was again
at Aberdeen.</p>

<p>The Adams Prize had been established in 1848 by
some members of St. John’s College, and connected
by them with the name of Adams “in testimony of
their sense of the honour he had conferred upon his
College and the University by having been the first
among the mathematicians of Europe to determine
from perturbations the unknown place of a disturbing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
planet exterior to Uranus.” Professor Challis, Dr.
Parkinson, and Sir William Thomson, the examiners,
had selected as the subject for the prize to be awarded
in 1857 the “Motions of Saturn’s Rings.” For this
Maxwell had decided to compete, and his letters at
the end of 1857 tell of the progress of the task.
Thus, writing<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> to Lewis Campbell from Glenlair on
August 28th, he <span class="locked">says:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have been battering away at Saturn, returning to the
charge every now and then. I have effected several breaches
in the solid ring, and now I am splash into the fluid one, amid
a clash of symbols truly astounding. When I reappear it will
be in the dusky ring, which is something like the state of the
air supposing the siege of Sebastopol conducted from a forest
of guns 100 miles one way, and 30,000 miles the other, and the
shot never to stop, but go spinning away round a circle, radius
170,000 miles.”</p>
</div>

<p class="in0">And again<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> to Miss Cay on the 28th of <span class="locked">November:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have been pretty steady at work since I came. The
class is small and not bright, but I am going to give them
plenty to do from the first, and I find it a good plan. I have
a large attendance of my old pupils, who go on with the higher
subjects. This is not part of the College course, so they come
merely from choice, and I have begun with the least amusing
part of what I intend to give them. Many had been reading
in summer, for they did very good papers for me on the old
subjects at the beginning of the month. Most of my spare
time I have been doing Saturn’s rings, which is getting on
now, but lately I have had a great many long letters to write—some
to Glenlair, some to private friends, and some all about
science.... I have had letters from Thomson and Challis
about Saturn—from Hayward, of Durham University, about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
the brass top, of which he wants one. He says that the earth
has been really found to change its axis regularly in the way
I supposed. Faraday has also been writing about his own
subjects. I have had also to write Forbes a long report on
colours; so that for every note I have got I have had to write
a couple of sheets in reply, and reporting progress takes a deal
of writing and spelling.”</p>
</div>

<p>He devised a model (now at the Cavendish
Laboratory) to exhibit the motions of the satellites
in a disturbed ring, “for the edification of sensible
image-worshippers.”</p>

<p>The essay was awarded the prize, and secured for
its author great credit among scientific men.</p>

<p>In another letter, written during the same session,
he says: “I find my principal work here is teaching
my men to avoid vague expressions, as ‘a certain
force,’ meaning uncertain; <em>may</em> instead of <em>must</em>;
<em>will be</em> instead of <em>is</em>; <em>proportional</em> instead of <em>equal</em>.”</p>

<p>The death, during the autumn, of his College
friend Pomeroy, from fever in India, was a great blow
to him; his letters at the time show the depth of his
feelings and his beliefs.</p>

<p>The question of the fusion of the two Colleges at
Aberdeen, King’s College and the Marischal College,
was coming to the fore. “Know all men,” he says,
in a letter to Professor Campbell, “that I am a
Fusionist.”</p>

<p>In February, 1858, he was still engaged on Saturn’s
rings, while hard at work during the same time with
his classes. He had established a voluntary class for
his students of the previous year, and was reading
with them Newton’s “Lunar Theory and Astronomy.”
This was followed by “Electricity and Magnetism,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
Faraday’s book being the backbone of everything, “as
he himself is the nucleus of everything electric
since 1830.”</p>

<p>In February, 1858, he announced his engagement
to Katherine Mary Dewar, the daughter of the
Principal of Marischal College.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Dear Aunt” (he says,<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> February 18th, 1858), “this comes
to tell you that I am going to have a wife....</p>

<p>“Don’t be afraid; she is not mathematical, but there are
other things besides that, and she certainly won’t stop mathematics.
The only one that can speak as an eye-witness is
Johnnie, and he only saw her when we were both trying to act
the indifferent. We have been trying it since, but it would
not do, and it was not good for either.”</p>
</div>

<p>The wedding took place early in June. Professor
Campbell has preserved some of the letters written
by Maxwell to Miss Dewar, and these contain “the
record of feelings which in the years that followed
were transfused in action and embodied in a married
life which can only be spoken of as one of unexampled
devotion.”</p>

<p>The project for the fusion of the two Colleges,
to which reference has been made, went on, and the
scheme was completed in 1860.</p>

<p>The two Colleges were united to form the University
of Aberdeen, and the new chair of Natural
Philosophy thus created was filled by the appointment
of David Thomson, Professor of Natural Philosophy
in King’s College, and Maxwell’s senior. Mr. W. D.
Niven, in his preface to Maxwell’s works, when
dealing with this appointment, <span class="locked">writes:—</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Professor Thomson, though not comparable to Maxwell
as a physicist, was nevertheless a remarkable man. He was
distinguished by singular force of character and great administrative
faculty, and he had been prominent in bringing
about the fusion of the Colleges. He was also an admirable
lecturer and teacher, and had done much to raise the standard
of scientific education in the north of Scotland. Thus the
choice made by the Commissioners, though almost inevitable,
had the effect of making it appear that Maxwell failed as a
teacher. There seems, however, to be no evidence to support
such an inference. On the contrary, if we may judge from the
number of voluntary students attending his classes in his last
College session, he would seem to have been as popular as a
professor as he was personally estimable.”</p>
</div>

<p>The question whether Maxwell was a great teacher
has sometimes been discussed. I trust that the
following pages will give an answer to it. He was
not a prominent lecturer. As Professor Campbell
says,<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> “Between his students’ ignorance and his vast
knowledge it was difficult to find a common measure.
The advice which he once gave to a friend whose
duty it was to preach to a country congregation,
‘Why don’t you give it them thinner?’ must often
have been applicable to himself.... Illustrations
of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ignotum per ignotius</i>, or of the abstruse
by some unobserved property of the familiar,
were multiplied with dazzling rapidity. Then the
spirit of indirectness and paradox, though he was
aware of its dangers, would often take possession of
him against his will, and, either from shyness or
momentary excitement, or the despair of making
himself understood, would land him in ‘chaotic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
statements,’ breaking off with some quirk of ironical
humour.”</p>

<p>But teaching is not all done by lecturing. His
books and papers are vast storehouses of suggestions
and ideas which the ablest minds of the past twenty
years have been since developing. To talk with him
for an hour was to gain inspiration for a year’s work;
to see his enthusiasm and to win his praise or
commendation were enough to compensate for many
weary struggles over some stubborn piece of apparatus
which would not go right, or some small source of
error which threatened to prove intractable and
declined to submit itself to calculation. The sure
judgment of posterity will confirm the verdict that
Clerk Maxwell was a great teacher, though lecturing
to a crowd of untrained undergraduates was a task
for which others were better fitted than he.</p>

<span class="subhead">PROFESSOR AT KING’S COLLEGE, LONDON.—LIFE
AT GLENLAIR.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">In</span> 1860 Forbes resigned the chair of Natural
Philosophy at Edinburgh. Maxwell and Tait were
candidates, and Tait was appointed. In the summer
of the same year Maxwell obtained the vacant
Professorship of Natural Philosophy at King’s College,
London. This he held to 1865, and this period of
his life is distinguished by the appearance of some of
his most important papers. The work was arduous;
the College course extended over nine months of the
year; there were as well evening lectures to artisans
as part of his regular duties. His life in London was
useful to him in the opportunities it gave him for
becoming personally acquainted with Faraday and
others. He also renewed his intimacy with various
Cambridge friends.</p>

<p>He was at the celebrated Oxford meeting of the
British Association in 1860, where he exhibited his
colour-box for mixing the colours of the spectrum.
In 1859, at the meeting at Aberdeen, he had read to
Section A his first paper on the “Dynamical Theory
of Gases,” published in the <i>Philosophical Magazine</i>
for January, 1860. The second part of the paper,
dealing with the conduction of heat and other
phenomena in a gas, was published in July, 1860,
after the Oxford meeting.</p>

<p>A paper on the “Theory of Compound Colours”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
was communicated to the Royal Society by Professor
Stokes in January, 1860. It contains the account of
his colour-box in the form finally adopted (most of
the important parts of the apparatus are still at the
Cavendish Laboratory), and a number of observations
by Mrs. Maxwell and himself, which will be more
fully described later.</p>

<p>In November, 1860, he received for this work the
Rumford medal of the Royal Society.</p>

<p>The next year, 1861, is of great importance in the
history of electrical science. The British Association
met at Manchester, and a Committee was appointed
on Standards of Electrical Resistance. Maxwell was
not a member. The committee reported at the
Cambridge meeting in 1862, and were reappointed
with extended duties. Maxwell’s name, among
others, was added, and he took a prominent part in
the deliberations of the committee, which, as their
Report<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> presented in 1863 states, came to the
opinion, “after mature consideration, that the system
of so-called absolute electrical units, based on
purely mechanical measurements, is not only the best
system yet proposed, but is the only one consistent
with our present knowledge both of the relations
existing between the various electrical phenomena and
of the connection between these and the fundamental
measurements of time, space, and mass.”</p>

<p>Appendix C of this Report, “On the Elementary
Relations between Electrical Measurements,” bears the
names of Clerk Maxwell and Fleeming Jenkin, and is
the foundation of everything that has been done in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
the way of absolute electrical measurement since that
date; while Appendix D gives an account by the
same two workers of the experiments on the absolute
unit of electrical resistance made in the laboratory of
King’s College by Maxwell, Fleeming Jenkin, and
Balfour Stewart. Further experiments are described
in the report for 1864. The work thus begun was
consummated during the year 1894 by the legalisation
throughout the civilised world of a system of electrical
units based on those described in these reports.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Maxwell’s views on electro-magnetic
theory were quietly developing. Papers on “Physical
Lines of Force,” which appeared in the <i>Philosophical
Magazine</i> during 1861 and 1862, contain the germs
of his theory—expressed at that time, it is true, in a
somewhat material form. In the paper published
January, 1862, the now well-known relation between
the ratio of the electric units and the velocity of light
was established, and his correspondence with Fleeming
Jenkin and C. J. Munro about this time relates in
part to the experimental verification of this relation.
His experiments on this matter were published in the
“Philosophical Transactions” for 1868.</p>

<p>This electrical theory occupied his mind mainly
during 1863 and 1864. In September of the latter
year he writes<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> from Glenlair to C. Hockin, who had
taken Balfour Stewart’s place during the second series
of experiments on the measurement of resistance.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have been doing several electrical problems. I have got
a theory of ‘electric absorption,’ <i>i.e.</i>, residual charge, etc., and
I very much want determinations of the specific induction,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
electric resistance, and absorption of good dielectrics, such as
glass, shell-lac, gutta-percha, ebonite, sulphur, etc.</p>

<p>“I have also cleared the electromagnetic theory of light
from all unwarrantable assumption, so that we may safely
determine the velocity of light by measuring the attraction
between bodies kept at a given difference of potential, the
value of which is known in electromagnetic measure.</p>

<p>“I hope there will be resistance coils at the British Association.”</p>
</div>

<p>This work resulted in his greatest electrical paper,
“A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field,”
read to the Royal Society December 8th, 1864.</p>

<p>But the molecular theory of gases was still
prominently before his mind.</p>

<p>In 1862, writing<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> to H. R. Droop, he <span class="locked">says:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Some time ago, when investigating Bernoulli’s theory
of gases, I was surprised to find that the internal friction of
a gas (if it depends on the collision of particles) should be
independent of the density.</p>

<p>“Stokes has been examining Graham’s experiments on the
rate of flow of gases through fine tubes, and he finds that the
friction, if independent of density, accounts for Graham’s
results; but, if taken proportional to density, differs from
those results very much. This seems rather a curious result,
and an additional phenomenon, explained by the ‘collision of
particles’ theory of gases. Still one phenomenon goes against
that theory—the relation between specific heat at constant
pressure and at constant volume, which is in air = 1·408,
while it ought to be 1·333.”</p>
</div>

<p class="in0">And again<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> in the same year, 21st April, 1862, to
Lewis <span class="locked">Campbell:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Herr Clausius of Zürich, one of the heat philosophers, has
been working at the theory of gases being little bodies flying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
about, and has found some cases in which he and I don’t tally.
So I am working it out again. Several experimental results
have turned up lately rather confirmatory than otherwise of
that theory.</p>

<p>“I hope you enjoy the absence of pupils. I find the division
of them into smaller classes is a great help to me and to them;
but the total oblivion of them for definite intervals is a
necessary condition for doing them justice at the proper time.”</p>
</div>

<p>The experiments on the viscosity of gases, which
formed the Bakerian Lecture to the Royal Society
read on February 8th, 1866, were the outcome of this
work. His house in 8, Palace Gardens, Kensington,
contained a large garret running the complete length.</p>

<p>“To maintain the proper temperature a large fire
was for some days kept up in the room in the midst
of very hot weather. Kettles were kept on the fire and
large quantities of steam allowed to flow into the
room. Mrs. Maxwell acted as stoker, which was very
exhausting work when maintained for several consecutive
hours. After this the room was kept cool for
subsequent experiments by the employment of a
considerable amount of ice.”</p>

<p>Next year, May, 1866, was read his paper on the
“Dynamical Theory of Gases,” in which errors in his
former papers, which had been pointed out by
Clausius, were corrected.</p>

<p>Meanwhile he had resigned his London Professorship
at the end of the Session of 1865, and had been
succeeded by Professor W. G. Adams.</p>

<p>For the next four years he lived chiefly at Glenlair,
working at his theory of electricity, occasionally, as
we shall see, visiting London and Cambridge, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
taking an active interest in the affairs of his own
neighbourhood. In 1865 he had a serious illness,
through which he was nursed with great care by Mrs.
Maxwell. His correspondence was considerable, and
absorbed much of his time. Much also was given to
the study of English literature; he was fond of
reading Chaucer, Milton, or Shakespeare aloud to
Mrs. Maxwell.</p>

<p>He also read much theological and philosophical
literature, and all he read helped only to strengthen
that firm faith in the fundamentals of Christianity in
which he lived and died.</p>

<p>In 1867 he and Mrs. Maxwell paid a visit to Italy,
which was a source of great pleasure to both.</p>

<p>His chief scientific work was the preparation of
his “Electricity and Magnetism,” which did not
appear till 1873; the time was in the main one of
quiet thought and preparation for his next great task,
the foundation of the School of Physics in Cambridge.</p>

<p>In 1868 the principalship of the United College
in the University of St. Andrews was vacant by the
resignation of Forbes, and Maxwell was invited by
several of the professors to stand. He, however,
declined to submit his name to the Crown.</p>

<span class="subhead">CAMBRIDGE.—PROFESSOR OF PHYSICS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">During</span> his retirement at Glenlair from 1865 to 1870
Maxwell was frequently at Cambridge. He examined
in the Mathematical Tripos in 1866 and 1867, and
again in 1869 and 1870.</p>

<p>The regulations for the Tripos had been in force
practically unchanged since 1848, and it was felt by
many that the range of subjects included was not
sufficiently extensive, and that changes were urgently
needed if Cambridge were to retain its position as the
centre of mathematical teaching. Natural Philosophy
was mentioned in the Schedule, but Natural Philosophy
included only Dynamics and Astronomy, Hydrostatics
and Physical Optics, with some simple Hydrodynamics
and Sound.</p>

<p>The subjects of Heat, Electricity and Magnetism,
the Theory of Elastic Solids and Vibrations, Vortex-Motion
in Hydrodynamics, and much else, were
practically new since 1848. Stokes, Thomson, and
Maxwell in England, and Helmholtz in Germany, had
created them.</p>

<p>Accordingly in June, 1868, a new plan of examinations
was sanctioned by the Senate to come into
force in January, 1873, and these various subjects
were explicitly included.</p>

<p>Mr. Niven, who was one of those examined by
Maxwell in 1866, writes in the preface to the collected
<span class="locked">works:—</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“For some years previous to 1866, when Maxwell returned
to Cambridge as Moderator in the Mathematical Tripos, the
studies in the University had lost touch with the great
scientific movements going on outside her walls. It was said
that some of the subjects most in vogue had but little interest
for the present generation, and loud complaints began to be
heard that while such branches of knowledge as Heat, Electricity,
and Magnetism were left out of the Tripos examination,
the candidates were wasting their time and energy upon
mathematical trifles barren of scientific interest and of
practical results. Into the movement for reform Maxwell
entered warmly. By his questions in 1866, and subsequent
years, he infused new life into the examination; he took an
active part in drafting the new scheme introduced in 1873;
but most of all by his writings he exerted a powerful influence
on the younger members of the University, and was largely
instrumental in bringing about the change which has been
now effected.”</p>
</div>

<p>But the University possessed no means of teaching
these subjects, and a Syndicate or Committee was
appointed, November 25th, 1868, “to consider the
best means of giving instruction to students in
Physics, especially in Heat, Electricity and Magnetism,
and the methods of providing apparatus for
this purpose.”</p>

<p>Dr. Cookson, Master of St. Peter’s College, took an
active part in the work of the Syndicate. Professor
Stokes, Professor Liveing, Professor Humphry, Dr.
Phear, and Dr. Routh were among the members.
Maxwell himself was in Cambridge that winter, as
Examiner for the Tripos, and his work as Moderator
and Examiner in the two previous years had done
much to show the necessity of alterations and to
indicate the direction which changes should take.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span></p>

<p>The Syndicate reported February 27th, 1869. They
called attention to the Report of the Royal Commission
of 1850. The Commissioners had “prominently
urged the importance of cultivating a knowledge of
the great branches of Experimental Physics in the
University”; and in page 118 of their Report, after
commending the manner in which the subject of
Physical Optics is studied in the University, and
pointing out that “there is, perhaps, no public institution
where it is better represented or prosecuted with
more zeal and success in the way of original research,”
they had stated that “no reason can be assigned why
other great branches of Natural Science should not
become equally objects of attention, or why Cambridge
should not become a great school of physical and
experimental, as it is already of mathematical and
classical, instruction.”</p>

<p>And again the Commissioners remark: “In a
University so thoroughly imbued with the mathematical
spirit, physical study might be expected to
assume within its precincts its highest and severest
tone, be studied under more abstract forms, with
more continual reference to mathematical laws, and
therefore with better hope of bringing them one by
one under the domain of mathematical investigation
than elsewhere.”</p>

<p>After calling attention to these statements the
Report of the Syndicate then <span class="locked">continues:—</span></p>

<p>“In the scheme of Examination for Honours in
the Mathematical Tripos approved by Grace of the
Senate on the 2nd of June, 1868, Heat, Electricity and
Magnetism, if not introduced for the first time, had a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
much greater degree of importance assigned to them
than at any previous period, and these subjects will
henceforth demand a corresponding amount of attention
from the candidates for Mathematical Honours.
The Syndicate have limited their attention almost
entirely to the question of providing public instruction
in Heat, Electricity and Magnetism. They recognise
the importance and advantage of tutorial instruction
in these subjects in the several colleges, but they are
also alive to the great impulse given to studies of this
kind, and to the large amount of additional training
which students may receive through the instruction
of a public Professor, and by knowledge gained in a
well-appointed laboratory.”</p>

<p>“In accordance with these views, and at an early
period in their deliberations, they requested the Professors<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a>
of the University, who are engaged in teaching
Mathematical and Physical Science, to confer together
upon the present means of teaching Experimental
Physics, especially Heat, Electricity and Magnetism,
and to inform them how the increased requirements
of the University in this respect could be met by
them.”</p>

<p>“The Professors, so consulted, favoured the Syndicate
with a report on the subject, which the Syndicate
now beg leave to lay before the Senate. It points out
how the requirements of the University might be
“partially met,” but the Professors state distinctly
that they “do not think that they are able to meet
the want of an extensive course of lectures on Physics<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
treated as such, and in great measure experimentally.
As Experimental Physics may fairly be considered to
come within the province of one or more of the above-mentioned
Professors, the Syndicate have considered
whether now or at some future time some arrangement
might not be made to secure the effective
teaching of this branch of science, without having
resort to the services of an additional Professor. They
are, however, of opinion that such an arrangement
cannot be made at the present time, and that the
exigencies of the case may be best met by founding a
new professorship which shall terminate with the
tenure of office of the Professor first elected. The
services of a man of the highest attainments in
science, devoting his life to public teaching as such
Professor, and engaged in original research, would be
of incalculable benefit to the University.”</p>

<p>The Report goes on to point out that a laboratory
would be necessary, and also apparatus. It is
estimated that £5,000 would cover the cost of the
laboratory, and £1,300 the necessary apparatus. Provision
is also made for a demonstrator and a laboratory
assistant, and the Report closes with a recommendation
that a special Syndicate of Finance should be
appointed to consider the means of raising the funds.</p>

<p>The Professors in their Report to the Syndicate
point out that teaching in Experimental Physics is
needed for the Mathematical Tripos, the Natural
Sciences Tripos, certain Special examinations, and the
first examination for the degree of M.B. It appeared
to them clear that there was work for a new Professor.</p>

<p>In May, 1869, the Financial Syndicate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
recommended by the above Report was appointed “to
consider the means of raising the necessary funds for
establishing a professor and demonstrator of Experimental
Physics, and for providing buildings and
apparatus required for that department of science,
and further to consider other wants of the University,
and the sources from which those wants may be
supplied.”</p>

<p>The Syndicate endeavoured to meet the expenditure
by inquiry from the several Colleges whether
they would be willing to make contributions from
their corporate funds, but without success.</p>

<p>“The answers of the Colleges indicated such a
want of concurrence in any proposal to raise contributions
from the corporate funds of Colleges by any
kind of direct taxation that the Syndicate felt obliged
to abandon the notion of obtaining the necessary funds
from this source, and accordingly to limit the number
of objects which they should recommend the Senate
to accomplish.”</p>

<p>External authority was necessary before the
colleges would submit to taxation for University
purposes, and it was left to the Royal Commission of
1877 to carry into effect many of the suggestions made
by the Syndicate. Meanwhile they contented themselves
with recommending means for raising an annual
stipend of £660 for the professor, demonstrator, and
assistant, and a capital sum of £5,000, or thereabouts,
for the expenses of a building.</p>

<p>The Syndicate’s Report was issued in an amended
form in the May term of 1870, and before any decision
was taken on it the Vice-Chancellor, Dr. Atkinson, on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
October 13th, 1870, published “the following munificent
offer of his grace the Duke of Devonshire, the
Chancellor of the University,” who had been chairman
of the Commission on Scientific Education.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="sigright">
<span class="l4">“Holker Hall,</span><br />
Grange, Lancashire.
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Mr. Vice-Chancellor</span>,—I have the honour to
address you for the purpose of making an offer to the University,
which, if you see no objection, I shall be much obliged to you
to submit in such manner as you may think fit for the consideration
of the Council and the University.</p>

<p>“I find in the report dated February 29th, 1869, of the
Physical Science Syndicate, recommending the establishment
of a Professor and Demonstrator of Experimental Physics, that
the buildings and apparatus required for this department of
science are estimated to cost £6,300.</p>

<p>“I am desirous to assist the University in carrying this
recommendation into effect, and shall accordingly be prepared
to provide the funds required for the building and apparatus
as soon as the University shall have in other respects completed
its arrangements for teaching Experimental Physics, and shall
have approved the plan of the building.</p>

<p class="sigright">
“I remain, my dear Mr. Vice-Chancellor,<br />
<span class="l2">“Yours very faithfully,</span><br />
“<span class="smcap">Devonshire</span>.”
</p>
</div>

<p>By his generous action the University was relieved
from all expense connected with the building. A
Grace establishing a Professorship of Experimental
Physics was confirmed by the Senate February 9th,
1871, and March 8th was fixed for the election.</p>

<p>Meanwhile who was to be Professor? Sir W.
Thomson’s name had been mentioned, but he, it was
known, would not accept the post. Maxwell was then
applied to, and at first he was unwilling to leave
Glenlair. Professor Stokes, the Hon. J. W. Strutt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
(Lord Rayleigh), Mr. Blore of Trinity, and others
wrote to him. Lord Rayleigh’s letter<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> is as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="sigright">
“Cambridge, 14th February, 1871.
</p>

<p>“When I came here last Friday I found everyone talking
about the new professorship, and hoping that you would come.
Thomson, it seems, has definitely declined.... There is
no one here in the least fit for the post. What is wanted by
most who know anything about it is not so much a lecturer as
a mathematician who has actual experience in experimenting,
and who might direct the energies of the younger Fellows and
bachelors into a proper channel. There must be many who
would be willing to work under a competent man, and who,
while learning themselves, would materially assist him....
I hope you may be induced to come; if not, I don’t know
who it is to be. Do not trouble to answer me about this, as I
believe others have written to you about it.”</p>
</div>

<p>On the 15th of February, Maxwell wrote to Mr.
<span class="locked">Blore:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I had no intention of applying for the post when I got
your letter, and I have none now, unless I come to see that I
can do some good by it.” The letter continues:—“The
class of Physical Investigations, which might be undertaken
with the help of men of Cambridge education, and which
would be creditable to the University, demand in general a
considerable amount of dull labour, which may or may not be
attractive to the pupils.”</p>
</div>

<p>However, on the 24th of February, Mr. Blore wrote
to the Electoral <span class="locked">Roll:—</span></p>

<p>“I am authorised to give notice that Mr. John (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">sic</i>)
Clerk Maxwell, F.R.S., formerly Professor of Natural
Philosophy at Aberdeen, and at King’s College,
London, is a candidate for the professorship of
Experimental Physics.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span></p>

<p>Maxwell was elected without opposition. Writing<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a>
to his wife from Cambridge, 20th March, 1871, he
<span class="locked">says:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“There are two parties about the professorship. One wants
popular lectures, and the other cares more for experimental
work. I think there should be a gradation—popular lectures
and rough experiments for the masses; real experiments for
real students; and laborious experiments for first-rate men
like Trotter and Stuart and Strutt.”</p>
</div>

<p class="in0">While in a letter<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> from Glenlair to C. J. Munro, dated
March 15th, 1871, he writes:—“The Experimental
Physics at Cambridge is not built yet, but we are
going to try. The desideratum is to set a Don and a
Freshman to observe and register (say) the vibrations
of a magnet together, or the Don to turn a watch and
the Freshman to observe and govern him.”</p>

<p>In October he delivered his Introductory Lecture.
A few quotations will show the spirit in which he
approached his task.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In a course of Experimental Physics we may consider
either the Physics or the Experiments as the leading feature.
We may either employ the experiments to illustrate the
phenomena of a particular branch of Physics, or we may
make some physical research in order to exemplify a particular
experimental method. In the order of time, we should begin,
in the Lecture Room, with a course of lectures on some branch
of Physics aided by experiments of illustration, and conclude,
in the Laboratory, with a course of experiments of research.</p>

<p>“Let me say a few words on these two classes of experiments—Experiments
of Illustration and Experiments of
Research. The aim of an experiment of illustration is to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
throw light upon some scientific idea so that the student may
be enabled to grasp it. The circumstances of the experiment
are so arranged that the phenomenon which we wish to observe
or to exhibit is brought into prominence, instead of being
obscured and entangled among other phenomena, as it is when
it occurs in the ordinary course of nature. To exhibit illustrative
experiments, to encourage others to make them, and to
cultivate in every way the ideas on which they throw light,
forms an important part of our duty. The simpler the
materials of an illustrative experiment, and the more familiar
they are to the student, the more thoroughly is he likely to
acquire the idea which it is meant to illustrate. The educational
value of such experiments is often inversely proportional
to the complexity of the apparatus. The student who uses
home-made apparatus, which is always going wrong, often
learns more than one who has the use of carefully adjusted
instruments, to which he is apt to trust, and which he dares
not take to pieces.</p>

<p>“It is very necessary that those who are trying to learn from
books the facts of physical science should be enabled by the
help of a few illustrative experiments to recognise these facts
when they meet with them out of doors. Science appears to
us with a very different aspect after we have found out that it
is not in lecture-rooms only, and by means of the electric light
projected on a screen, that we may witness physical phenomena,
but that we may find illustrations of the highest doctrines of
science in games and gymnastics, in travelling by land and by
water, in storms of the air and of the sea, and wherever there
is matter in motion.</p>

<p>“If, therefore, we desire, for our own advantage and for the
honour of our University, that the Devonshire Laboratory
should be successful, we must endeavour to maintain it in
living union with the other organs and faculties of our learned
body. We shall therefore first consider the relation in which
we stand to those mathematical studies which have so long
flourished among us, which deal with our own subjects, and
which differ from our experimental studies only in the mode in
which they are presented to the mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span></p>

<p>“There is no more powerful method for introducing knowledge
into the mind than that of presenting it in as many
different ways as we can. When the ideas, after entering
through different gateways, effect a junction in the citadel of
the mind, the position they occupy becomes impregnable.
Opticians tell us that the mental combination of the views of
an object which we obtain from stations no further apart than
our two eyes is sufficient to produce in our minds an impression
of the solidity of the object seen; and we find that this impression
is produced even when we are aware that we are
really looking at two flat pictures placed in a stereoscope. It
is therefore natural to expect that the knowledge of physical
science obtained by the combined use of mathematical analysis
and experimental research will be of a more solid, available,
and enduring kind than that possessed by the mere mathematician
or the mere experimenter.</p>

<p>“But what will be the effect on the University if men
pursuing that course of reading which has produced so many
distinguished Wranglers turn aside to work experiments?
Will not their attendance at the Laboratory count not merely
as time withdrawn from their more legitimate studies, but as
the introduction of a disturbing element, tainting their mathematical
conceptions with material imagery, and sapping their
faith in the formulæ of the text-books? Besides this, we have
already heard complaints of the undue extension of our studies,
and of the strain put upon our questionists by the weight of
learning which they try to carry with them into the Senate-House.
If we now ask them to get up their subjects not only
by books and writing, but at the same time by observation and
manipulation, will they not break down altogether? The
Physical Laboratory, we are told, may perhaps be useful to
those who are going out in Natural Science, and who do not
take in Mathematics, but to attempt to combine both kinds of
study during the time of residence at the University is more
than one mind can bear.</p>

<p>“No doubt there is some reason for this feeling. Many of
us have already overcome the initial difficulties of mathematical
training. When we now go on with our study, we feel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
that it requires exertion and involves fatigue, but we are confident
that if we only work hard our progress will be certain.</p>

<p>“Some of us, on the other hand, may have had some
experience of the routine of experimental work. As soon as
we can read scales, observe times, focus telescopes, and so on,
this kind of work ceases to require any great mental effort.
We may, perhaps, tire our eyes and weary our backs, but we
do not greatly fatigue our minds.</p>

<p>“It is not till we attempt to bring the theoretical part of
our training into contact with the practical that we begin to
experience the full effect of what Faraday has called ‘mental
inertia’—not only the difficulty of recognising, among the
concrete objects before us, the abstract relation which we have
learned from books, but the distracting pain of wrenching the
mind away from the symbols to the objects, and from the
objects back to the symbols. This, however, is the price we
have to pay for new ideas.</p>

<p>“But when we have overcome these difficulties, and
successfully bridged over the gulph between the abstract and
the concrete, it is not a mere piece of knowledge that we have
obtained; we have acquired the rudiment of a permanent
mental endowment. When, by a repetition of efforts of this
kind, we have more fully developed the scientific faculty, the
exercise of this faculty in detecting scientific principles in
nature, and in directing practice by theory, is no longer irksome,
but becomes an unfailing source of enjoyment, to which
we return so often that at last even our careless thoughts
begin to run in a scientific channel.</p>

<p>“Our principal work, however, in the Laboratory must be
to acquaint ourselves with all kinds of scientific methods, to
compare them and to estimate their value. It will, I think,
be a result worthy of our University, and more likely to be
accomplished here than in any private laboratory, if, by the
free and full discussion of the relative value of different
scientific procedures, we succeed in forming a school of
scientific criticism and in assisting the development of the
doctrine of method.</p>

<p>“But admitting that a practical acquaintance with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
methods of Physical Science is an essential part of a mathematical
and scientific education, we may be asked whether we
are not attributing too much importance to science altogether
as part of a liberal education.</p>

<p>“Fortunately, there is no question here whether the
University should continue to be a place of liberal education,
or should devote itself to preparing young men for particular
professions. Hence, though some of us may, I hope, see reason
to make the pursuit of science the main business of our lives,
it must be one of our most constant aims to maintain a living
connexion between our work and the other liberal studies of
Cambridge, whether literary, philological, historical, or
philosophical.</p>

<p>“There is a narrow professional spirit which may grow up
among men of science just as it does among men who practise
any other special business. But surely a University is the
very place where we should be able to overcome this tendency
of men to become, as it were, granulated into small worlds,
which are all the more worldly for their very smallness? We
lose the advantage of having men of varied pursuits collected
into one body if we do not endeavour to imbibe some of the
spirit even of those whose special branch of learning is different
from our own.”</p>
</div>

<p>Another expression of his views on the position of
Physics at the time will be found in his address to
Section A of the British Association, when President
at the Liverpool meeting of 1870.</p>

<span class="subhead">CAMBRIDGE—THE CAVENDISH LABORATORY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">But</span> the laboratory was not yet built. A Syndicate,
of which Maxwell was a member, was appointed to
consider the question of a site, to take professional
advice, and to obtain plans and estimates. Professor
Maxwell and Mr. Trotter visited various laboratories
at home and abroad for the purpose of ascertaining
the best arrangements. Mr. W. M. Fawcett was
appointed architect; the tender of Mr. John Loveday,
of Kebworth, for the building at a cost of £8,450,
exclusive of gas, water, and heating, was accepted in
March, 1872, and the building<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> was begun during the
summer.</p>

<p>In the meantime Maxwell began to lecture, finding
a home where he could.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Lectures begin 24th,” he writes from Glenlair, October
19th, 1872. “Laboratory rising, I hear, but I have no place
to erect my chair, but move about like the cuckoo, depositing
my notions in the Chemical Lecture-room 1st term; in the
Botanical in Lent, and in Comparative Anatomy in Easter.”</p>
</div>

<p>It was not till June, 1874, that the building was
complete, and on the 16th the Chancellor formally
presented his gift of the Cavendish Laboratory to the
University. In the correspondence previous to this
time it was spoken of as the Devonshire Laboratory.
The name Cavendish commemorated the work of the
great physicist of a century earlier, whose writings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
Maxwell was shortly to edit, as well as the generosity
of the Chancellor.</p>

<p>In their letter of thanks to the Duke of Devonshire
the University <span class="locked">write:—</span></p>

<p>“<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Unde vero conventius poterat illis artibus
succurri quam e tua domo quæ in ipsis jam pridem
inclaruerat. Notum est Henricum Cavendish quem
secutus est Coulombius primum ita docuisse, quæ sit
vis electrica ut eam numerorum modulis illustraret;
adhibitis rationibus quas hodie veras esse constat.</span>”
And they suggest the name as suitable for the
building. To this the Chancellor replied, after referring
to the work of Henry Cavendish: “<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Quod
pono in officinâ ipsâ nuncupandâ nomen ejus commemorare
dignati sitis, id grato animo accepi.</span>”</p>

<p>The building had cost far more than the original
estimate, but the Chancellor’s generosity was not
limited, and on July 21st, 1874, he wrote to the <span class="locked">Vice-Chancellor:—</span></p>

<p>“It is my wish to provide all instruments for the
Cavendish Laboratory which Professor Maxwell may
consider to be immediately required, either in his
lectures or otherwise.”</p>

<p>Maxwell prepared a list, but explained while doing
it that time and thought were necessary to secure the
best form of instruments; and he continues, writing to
the Vice-Chancellor: “I think the Duke fully understood
from what I said to him that to furnish the
Laboratory will be a matter of several years’ duration.
I shall consider myself, however,” he says, “at liberty
to contribute to the Laboratory any instruments
which I have had constructed in former years, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
which may be found still useful, and also from time to
time to procure others for special researches.”</p>

<p>In 1877 in his annual report Professor Maxwell
announced that the Chancellor<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> had now “completed
his gift to the University by furnishing the Cavendish
Laboratory with apparatus suited to the present state
of science.”</p>

<p>The stock of apparatus, however, was still small,
although Maxwell in the most generous manner
himself spent large sums in adding to it; for the
Professor was most particular in procuring only
expensive instruments by the best makers, with such
additional improvements as he could himself suggest.</p>

<p>In March, 1874, a Demonstratorship of Physics
had been established, and Mr. Garnett of St. John’s
College was appointed.</p>

<p>Work began in the laboratory in October, 1874.
At first the number of students was small. Only
seventeen names appear in the Natural Sciences
Tripos<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> list for 1874, and few of those did Physics.</p>

<p>The fear alluded to by the Professor in his introductory
lecture, that men reading for the Mathematical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
Tripos would not find time for attendance at the
laboratory, was justified. One of the weaknesses of
our Cambridge plan has been the divorce between
Mathematics and experimental work, encouraged
by our system of examinations. Experimental
knowledge is supposed not to be needed for the
Mathematical Tripos; the Mathematics permitted in
the Natural Sciences Tripos are very simple; thus
it came about that few men while reading for the
Mathematical Tripos attended the laboratory, and
this unfortunate result was intensified by the action
of the University in 1877–78, when the regulations
for the Mathematical Tripos were again altered.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a></p>

<p>Still there were pupils eager and willing to work,
though they were chiefly men who had already taken
their B.A. degree, and who wished to continue
Physical reading and research, even though it involved
“a considerable amount of dull labour not
altogether attractive.” My own work there began in
1876, and it may be interesting if I recall my reminiscences
of that time.</p>

<p>The first experiments I can recollect related to the
measurement of electrical resistance. I well remember<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
Maxwell explaining the principle of Wheatstone’s
bridge, and my own wish at the time that I had come
to the laboratory before the Tripos, instead of afterwards.
Lord Rayleigh had, during the examination,
set an easy question which I failed to do for want
of some slight experimental knowledge, and the first
few words of Maxwell’s talk showed me the solution.</p>

<p>I did not attend his lectures regularly—they were
given, I think, at an hour which I was obliged to
devote to teaching; besides, there was his book, the
“Electricity and Magnetism,” into which I had just
dipped before the Tripos, to work at.</p>

<p>Chrystal and Saunder were then busy at their
verification of Ohm’s law. They were using a number
of the Thomson form of tray Daniell’s cells, and
Maxwell was anxious for tests of various kinds to
be made on these cells; these I undertook, and
spent some time over various simple measurements
on them. He then set me to work at some of the
properties of a stratified dielectric, consisting, if I
remember rightly, of sheets of paraffin paper and
mica. By this means I became acquainted with
various pieces of apparatus. There were no regular
classes and no set drill of demonstrations arranged
for examination purposes; these came later. In Maxwell’s
time those who wished to work had the use of
the laboratory and assistance and help from him, but
they were left pretty much to themselves to find out
about the apparatus and the best methods of using it.</p>

<p>Rather later than this Schuster came and did
some of his spectroscope work. J. E. H. Gordon
was busy with the preliminary observations for his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
determination of Verdet’s constant, and Niven had
various electrical experiments on hand; while Fleming
was at work on the B. A. resistance coils.</p>

<p>My own tastes lay in the direction of optics.
Maxwell was anxious that I should investigate the
properties of certain crystals. I think they were the
chlorate of potash crystals, about which Stokes and
Rayleigh have since written; but these crystals were
to be grown, a slow process which would, he supposed,
take years; and as I wished to produce a dissertation
for the Trinity Fellowship examination in 1877, that
work had to be laid aside.</p>

<p>Eventually I selected as a subject the form of the
wave surface in a biaxial crystal, and set to work in
a room assigned to me. The Professor used to come
in on most days to see how I was getting on. Generally
he brought his dog, which sometimes was shut up in
the next room while he went to college. Dogs were
not allowed in college, and Maxwell had an amusing
way of describing how Toby once wandered into
Trinity, and by some doggish instinct discovered
immediately, to his intense amazement, that he was
in a place where no dogs had been since the college
was. Toby was not always quiet in his master’s
absence, and his presence in the next room was somewhat
disturbing.</p>

<p>When difficulties occurred Maxwell was always
ready to listen. Often the answer did not come at
once, but it always did come after a little time. I
remember one day, when I was in a serious dilemma,
I told him my long tale, and he <span class="locked">said:—</span></p>

<p>“Well, Chrystal has been talking to me, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
Garnett and Schuster have been asking questions,
and all this has formed a good thick crust round my
brain. What you have said will take some time to
soak through, but we will see about it.” In a few
days he came back with—“I have been thinking
over what you said the other day, and if you do so-and-so
it will be all right.”</p>

<p>My dissertation was referred to him, and on the
day of the election, when returning to Cambridge for
the admission, I met him at Bletchley station, and
well remember his kind congratulations and words
of warm encouragement.</p>

<p>For the next year and a half I was working
regularly at the laboratory and saw him almost daily
during term time.</p>

<p>Of these last years there really is but little to tell.
His own scientific work went on. The “Electricity
and Magnetism” was written mostly at Glenlair.
About the time of his return to Cambridge, in October,
1872, he writes<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> to Lewis <span class="locked">Campbell:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am continually engaged in stirring up the Clarendon
Press, but they have been tolerably regular for two months. I
find nine sheets in thirteen weeks is their average. Tait gives
me great help in detecting absurdities. I am getting converted
to quaternions, and have put some in my book.”</p>
</div>

<p>The book was published in 1873. The Text-book
of Heat was written during the same period, while
“Matter and Motion,” “a small book on a great
subject,” was published in 1876.</p>

<p>In 1873 and 1874 he was one of the examiners for
the Natural Sciences Tripos, and in 1873 he was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
first additional examiner for the Mathematical Tripos,
in accordance with the scheme which he had done so
much to promote in 1868.</p>

<p>Many of his shorter papers were written about the
same time. The ninth edition of the <i>Encyclopædia
Britannica</i> was being published, and Professor Baynes
had enlisted his aid in the work. The articles
“Atom,” “Attraction,” “Capillary Action,” “Constitution
of Bodies,” “Diffusion,” “Ether,” “Faraday,” and
others are by him.</p>

<p>He also wrote a number of papers for <i>Nature</i>.
Some of these are reviews of books or accounts of
scientific men, such as the notices of Faraday and
Helmholtz, which appeared with their portraits;
others again are original contributions to science.
Among the latter many have reference to the
molecular constitution of bodies. Two lectures—the
first on “Molecules,” delivered before the British
Association at Bradford in 1873; the second on the
“Dynamical Evidence of the Molecular Constitution
of Bodies,” delivered before the Chemical Society in
1875—were of special importance. The closing
sentences of the first lecture have been often quoted.
They run as <span class="locked">follow:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In the heavens we discover by their light, and by their
light alone, stars so distant from each other that no material
thing can ever have passed from one to another; and yet this
light, which is to us the sole evidence of the existence of these
distant worlds, tells us also that each of them is built up of
molecules of the same kinds as those which we find on earth.
A molecule of hydrogen, for example, whether in Sirius or in
Arcturus, executes its vibrations in precisely the same time.</p>

<p>“Each molecule therefore throughout the universe bears<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
impressed upon it the stamp of a metric system, as distinctly
as does the metre of the Archives at Paris, or the double royal
cubit of the temple of Karnac.</p>

<p>“No theory of evolution can be formed to account for the
similarity of molecules, for evolution necessarily implies continuous
change, and the molecule is incapable of growth or
decay, of generation or destruction.</p>

<p>“None of the processes of Nature, since the time when
Nature began, have produced the slightest difference in the
properties of any molecule. We are therefore unable to
ascribe either the existence of the molecules or the identity
of their properties to any of the causes which we call natural.</p>

<p>“On the other hand, the exact equality of each molecule to
all others of the same kind gives it, as Sir John Herschel has
well said, the essential character of a manufactured article,
and precludes the idea of its being eternal and self-existent.</p>

<p>“Thus we have been led along a strictly scientific path,
very near to the point at which Science must stop—not that
Science is debarred from studying the internal mechanism of a
molecule which she cannot take to pieces any more than from
investigating an organism which she cannot put together. But
in tracing back the history of matter, Science is arrested when
she assures herself, on the one hand, that the molecule has
been made, and, on the other, that it has not been made by
any of the processes we call natural.</p>

<p>“Science is incompetent to reason upon the creation of
matter itself out of nothing. We have reached the utmost
limits of our thinking faculties when we have admitted that
because matter cannot be eternal and self-existent, it must
have been created.</p>

<p>“It is only when we contemplate, not matter in itself, but
the form in which it actually exists, that our mind finds something
on which it can lay hold.</p>

<p>“That matter, as such, should have certain fundamental
properties, that it should exist in space and be capable of
motion, that its motion should be persistent, and so on, are
truths which may, for anything we know, be of the kind which
metaphysicians call necessary. We may use our knowledge of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
such truths for purposes of deduction, but we have no data for
speculating as to their origin.</p>

<p>“But that there should be exactly so much matter and no
more in every molecule of hydrogen is a fact of a very different
order. We have here a particular distribution of matter—a
<em>collocation</em>, to use the expression of Dr. Chalmers, of things
which we have no difficulty in imagining to have been arranged
otherwise.</p>

<p>“The form and dimensions of the orbits of the planets, for
instance, are not determined by any law of nature, but depend
upon a particular collocation of matter. The same is the case
with respect to the size of the earth, from which the standard
of what is called the metrical system has been derived. But
these astronomical and terrestrial magnitudes are far inferior
in scientific importance to that most fundamental of all
standards which forms the base of the molecular system.
Natural causes, as we know, are at work which tend to modify,
if they do not at length destroy, all the arrangements and
dimensions of the earth and the whole solar system. But
though in the course of ages catastrophes have occurred and
may yet occur in the heavens, though ancient systems may be
dissolved and new systems evolved out of their ruins, the
molecules out of which these systems are built—the foundation
stones of the material universe—remain unbroken and unworn.
They continue this day as they were created—perfect in
number and measure and weight; and from the ineffaceable
characters impressed on them we may learn that those aspirations
after accuracy in measurement, and justice in action,
which we reckon among our noblest attributes as men, are
ours because they are essential constituents of the image of
Him who in the beginning created, not only the heaven and
the earth, but the materials of which heaven and earth consist.”</p>
</div>

<p>This was criticised in <i>Nature</i> by Mr. C. J. Munro,
and at a later time by Clifford in one of his essays.</p>

<p>Some correspondence with the Bishop of Gloucester
and Bristol on the authority for the comparison
of molecules to manufactured articles is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
given by Professor Campbell, and in it Maxwell
points out that the latter part of the article “Atom”
in the <i>Encyclopædia</i> is intended to meet Mr. Munro’s
criticism.</p>

<p>In 1874 the British Association met at Belfast,
under the presidency of Tyndall. Maxwell was present,
and published afterwards in <i>Blackwood’s Magazine</i>
an amusing paraphrase of the president’s address.
This, with some other verses written at about the
same time, may be quoted here. Professor Campbell
has collected a number of verses written by Maxwell
at various times, which illustrate in an admirable
manner both the grave and the gay side of his
character.</p>

<p>Another task, which occupied much time, from
1874 to 1879, was the edition of the works of Henry
Cavendish. Cavendish, who was great-uncle to the
Chancellor, had published only two electrical papers,
but he had left some twenty packets of manuscript
on Mathematical and Experimental Electricity.
These were placed in Maxwell’s hands in 1874 by the
Duke of Devonshire.</p>

<p>Niven, in his preface to the collected papers
dealing with this book, writes <span class="locked">thus:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“This work, published in 1879, has had the effect of
increasing the reputation of Cavendish, disclosing as it does
the unsuspected advances which that acute physicist had
made in the Theory of Electricity, especially in the measurement
of electrical quantities. The work is enriched by a
variety of valuable notes, in which Cavendish’s views and
results are examined by the light of modern theory and
methods. Especially valuable are the methods applied to the
determination of the electrical capacities of conductors and
condensers, a subject in which Cavendish himself showed considerable
skill both of a mathematical and experimental
character.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span></p>

<p>“The importance of the task undertaken by Maxwell in
connection with Cavendish’s papers will be understood from
the following extract from his introduction to <span class="locked">them:—</span></p>

<p>“‘It is somewhat difficult to account for the fact that
though Cavendish had prepared a complete description of his
experiments on the charges of bodies, and had even taken the
trouble to write out a fair copy, and though all this seems to
have been done before 1774, and he continued to make experiments
in electricity till 1781, and lived on till 1810, he kept
his manuscript by him and never published it.</p>

<p>“‘Cavendish cared more for investigation than for publication.
He would undertake the most laborious researches in
order to clear up a difficulty which no one but himself could
appreciate or was even aware of, and we cannot doubt that the
result of his enquiries, when successful, gave him a certain
degree of satisfaction. But it did not excite in him that
desire to communicate the discovery to others, which in the
case of ordinary men of science generally ensures the publication
of their results. How completely these researches of
Cavendish remained unknown to other men of science is shown
by the external history of electricity.’</p>

<p>“It will probably be thought a matter of some difficulty
to place oneself in the position of a physicist of a century
ago, and to ascertain the exact bearing of his experiments.
But Maxwell entered upon this undertaking with the utmost
enthusiasm, and succeeded in identifying himself with
Cavendish’s methods. He showed that Cavendish had really
anticipated several of the discoveries in electrical science
which have been made since his time. Cavendish was the
first to form the conception of and to measure Electrostatic
Capacity and Specific Inductive Capacity; he also anticipated
Ohm’s law.”</p>
</div>

<p>During the last years of his life Mrs. Maxwell had
a serious and prolonged illness, and Maxwell’s work
was much increased by his duties as sick nurse. On
one occasion he did not sleep in a bed for three weeks,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
but conducted his lectures and experiments at the
laboratory as usual.</p>

<p>About this time some of those who had been
“Apostles” in 1853–57 revived the habit of meeting
together for discussion. The club, which included
Professors Lightfoot, Hort and Westcott, was christened
the “Eranus,” and three of Maxwell’s contributions
to it have been preserved and are printed by
Professor Campbell.</p>

<p>After the Cavendish papers were finished, Maxwell
had more time for his own original researches,
and two important papers were published in 1879.
The one on “Stresses in Rarefied Gases arising from
Inequalities of Temperature” was printed in the
Royal Society’s Transactions, and deals with the
Theory of the Radiometer; the other on “Boltzmann’s
Theorem” appears in the Transactions of the Cambridge
Philosophical Society. In the previous year
he had delivered the Rede lecture on “The Telephone.”
He also began to prepare a second edition
of “Electricity and Magnetism.”</p>

<p>His health gave way during the Easter term of
1879; indeed for two years previously he had been
troubled with dyspeptic symptoms, but had consulted
no one on the subject. He left Cambridge as
usual in June, hoping that he would quickly recover
at Glenlair, but he grew worse instead. In October
he was told by Dr. Sanders of Edinburgh that he had
not a month to live. He returned to Cambridge in
order to be under the care of Dr. Paget, who was able
in some measure to relieve his most severe suffering
but the disease, of which his mother had died at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
same age, continued its progress, and he died on
November 5th. His one care during his last illness
was for those whom he left behind. Mrs. Maxwell
was an invalid dependent on him for everything, and
the thought of her helplessness was the one thing
which in these last days troubled him.</p>

<p>A funeral service took place in the chapel at
Trinity College, and afterwards his remains were conveyed
to Scotland and interred in the family burying-place
at Corsock, Kirkcudbright.</p>

<p>A memorial edition of his works was issued by
the Cambridge University Press in 1890. A portrait
by Lowes Dickinson hangs in the hall of Trinity
College, and there is a bust by Boehm in the
laboratory.</p>

<p>After his death Mrs. Maxwell gave his scientific
library to the Cavendish Laboratory, and on her
death she left a sum of about £6,000 to found a
scholarship in Physics, to be held at the laboratory.</p>

<p>The preceding pages contain some account of
Clerk Maxwell’s life as a man of science. His
character had other sides, and any life of him
would be incomplete without some brief reference to
these. His letters to his wife and to other intimate
friends show throughout his life the depth of his
religious convictions. The high purpose evidenced
in the paper given to the present Dean of Canterbury
when leaving Cambridge, animated him continually,
and appears from time to time in his writings. The
student’s evening hymn, composed in 1853 when still
an undergraduate, expresses the same <span class="locked">feelings—</span></p>

<p>“But I should be very sorry if an interpretation founded
on a most conjectural scientific hypothesis were to get fastened
to the text in Genesis, even if by so doing it got rid of
the old statement of the commentators which has long ceased
to be intelligible. The rate of change of scientific hypothesis
is naturally much more rapid than that of Biblical interpretations,
so that if an interpretation is founded on such an
hypothesis, it may help to keep the hypothesis above ground

<span class="subhead">SCIENTIFIC WORK—COLOUR VISION.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Fifteen</span> years only have passed since the death of
Clerk Maxwell, and it is almost too soon to hope
to form a correct estimate of the value of his work
and its relation to that of others who have laboured
in the same field.</p>

<p>Thus Niven, at the close of his obituary notice
in the Proceedings of the Royal Society, says: “It
is seldom that the faculties of invention and exposition,
the attachment to physical science and capability
of developing it mathematically, have been
found existing in one mind to the same degree. It
would, however, require powers somewhat akin to
Maxwell’s own to describe the more delicate features of
the works resulting from this combination, every one
of which is stamped with the subtle but unmistakable
impress of genius.” And again in the preface to
Maxwell’s works, issued in 1890, he wrote: “Nor
does it appear to the present editor that the time
has yet arrived when the quickening influence of
Maxwell’s mind on modern scientific thought can be
duly estimated.”</p>

<p>It is, however, the object of the present series
to attempt to give some account of the work of men
of science of the last hundred years, and to show how
each has contributed his share to our present stock of
knowledge. This task, then, remains to be done.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
While attempting it I wish to express my indebtedness
to others who have already written about Maxwell’s
scientific work, especially to Mr. W. D. Niven,
whose preface to the Maxwell papers has been so often
referred to; to Mr. Garnett, the author of Part II.
of the “Life of Maxwell,” which deals with his contributions
to science; and to Professor Tait, who in
<i>Nature</i> for February 5th, 1880, gave an account of
Clerk Maxwell’s work, “necessarily brief, but sufficient
to let even the non-mathematical reader see how
very great were his contributions to modern science”—an
account all the more interesting because, again
to quote from Professor Tait, “I have been intimately
acquainted with him since we were schoolboys
together.”</p>

<p>Maxwell’s main contributions to science may be
classified under three heads—“Colour Perception,”
“Molecular Physics,” and “Electrical Theories.” In
addition to these there were other papers of the
highest interest and importance, such as the essay on
“Saturn’s Rings,” the paper on the “Equilibrium of
Elastic Solids,” and various memoirs on pure geometry
and questions of mechanics, which would, if they stood
alone, have secured for their author a distinguished
position as a physicist and mathematician, but which
are not the works by which his name will be mostly
remembered.</p>

<p>The work on “Colour Perception” was begun at
an early date. We have seen Maxwell while still at
Edinburgh interested in the discussions about Hay’s
theories.</p>

<p>His first published paper on the subject was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
letter to Dr. G. Wilson, printed in the Transactions of
the Royal Society of Arts for 1855; but he had been
mixing colours by means of his top for some little time
previously, and the results of these experiments are
given in a paper entitled “Experiments on Colour,”
communicated to the Royal Society of Edinburgh
by Dr. Gregory, and printed in their Transactions,
vol. xxi.</p>

<p>In the paper on “The Theory of Compound
Colours,” printed in the Philosophical Transactions
for 1860, Maxwell gives a history of the theory as
it was known to him.</p>

<p>He points out first the distinction between the
<em>optical</em> properties and the <em>chromatic</em> properties of a
beam of light. “The optical properties are those
which have reference to its origin and propagation
through media until it falls on the sensitive organ of
vision;” they depend on the periods and amplitudes
of the ether vibrations which compose the beam.
“The chromatic properties are those which have
reference to its power of exciting certain sensations of
colour perceived through the organ of vision.” It is
possible for two beams to be optically very different
and chromatically alike. The converse is not true;
two beams which are optically alike are also chromatically
alike.</p>

<p>The foundation of the theory of compound colours
was laid by Newton. He first shewed that “by the
mixture of homogeneal light colours may be produced
which are like to the colours of homogeneal
light as to the appearance of colour, but not as to the
immutability of colour and constitution of light.” Two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
beams which differ optically may yet be alike chromatically;
it is possible by mixing red and yellow to
obtain an orange colour chromatically similar to the
orange of the spectrum, but optically different to that
orange, for the compound orange can be analysed by
a prism into its component red and yellow; the
spectrum orange is incapable of further resolution.</p>

<p>Newton also solves the following <span class="locked">problem:—</span></p>

<p><em>In a mixture of primary colours, the quantity
and quality of each being given to know the colour
of the compound</em> (Optics, Book 1, Part 2, Prop. 6),
and his solution is the following:—He arranges the
seven colours of the spectrum round the circumference
of a circle, the length occupied by each colour
being proportional to the musical interval to which,
in Newton’s views, the colour corresponded. At the
centre of gravity of each of these arcs he supposes a
weight placed proportional to the number of rays of
the corresponding colour which enter into the mixture
under consideration. The position of the centre of
gravity of these weights indicates the nature of the
resultant colour. A radius drawn through this centre
of gravity points out the colour of the spectrum which
it most resembles; the distance of the centre of gravity
from the centre gives the fulness of the colour.
The centre itself is white. Newton gives no proof
of this rule; he merely says, “This rule I conceive to
be accurate enough for practice, though not mathematically
accurate.”</p>

<p>Maxwell proved that Newton’s method of finding
the centre of gravity of the component colours was
confirmed by his observations, and that it involves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
mathematically the theory of three elements of colour;
but the disposition of the colours on the circle was
only a provisional arrangement; the true relations
of the colours could only be determined by direct
experiment.</p>

<p>Thomas Young appears to have been the next, after
Newton, to work at the theory of colour sensation. He
made observations by spinning coloured discs much
in the same way as that which was afterwards adopted
by Maxwell, and he developed the theory that three
different primary sensations may be excited in the eye
by light, while the colour of any beam depends on
the proportions in which these three sensations are
excited. He supposes the three primary sensations to
correspond to red, green, and violet. A blue ray is
capable of exciting both the green and the violet; a
yellow ray excites the red and the green. Any colour,
according to Young’s theory, may be matched by a
mixture of these three primary colours taken in proper
proportion; the quality of the colour depends on
the proportion of the intensities of the components;
its brightness depends on the sum of these
intensities.</p>

<p>Maxwell’s experiments were undertaken with the
object of proving or disproving the physical part of
Young’s theory. He does not consider the question
whether there are three distinct sensations corresponding
to the three primary colours; that is a
physiological inquiry, and one to which no completely
satisfactory answer has yet been given. He does show
that by a proper mixture of any three arbitrarily
chosen standard colours it is possible to match any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
other colour; the words “proper mixture,” however,
need, as will appear shortly, some development.</p>

<p>We may with advantage compare the problem
with one in acoustics.</p>

<p>When a compound musical note consisting of
a pure tone and its overtones is sounded, the
trained ear can distinguish the various overtones
and analyse the sound into its simple components.
The same sensation cannot be excited in two different
ways. The eye has no such corresponding power.
A given yellow may be a pure spectral yellow, corresponding
to a pure tone in music, or it may be a
mixture of a number of other pure tones; in either
case it can be matched by a proper combination of
three standard colours—this Maxwell proved. It
may be, as Young supposed, that if the three standard
colours be properly selected they correspond exactly
to three primary sensations of the brain. Maxwell’s
experiments do not afford any light on this point,
which still remains more than doubtful.</p>

<p>When Maxwell began his work the theory of
colours was exciting considerable interest. Sir David
Brewster had recently developed a new theory of
colour sensation which had formed the basis of some
discussions, and in 1852 von Helmholtz published
his first paper on the subject. According to Brewster,
the three primitive colours were red, yellow and blue,
and he supposed that they corresponded to three
different kinds of objective light. Helmholtz pointed
out that experiments up to that date had been conducted
by mixing pigments, with the exception of those
in which the rotating disc was used, and that it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
necessary to make them on the rays of the spectrum
itself. He then describes a method of mixing the
light from two spectra so as to obtain the combination
of every two of the simple prismatic rays in all
degrees of relative strength.</p>

<p>From these experiments results, which at the time
were unexpected, but some of which must have been
known to Young, were obtained. Among them it
was shown that a mixture of red and green made
yellow, while one of green and violet produced blue.</p>

<p>In a later paper (<i>Philosophical Magazine</i>, 1854)
Helmholtz described a method for ascertaining the
various pairs of complementary colours—colours, that
is, which when mixed will give white—which had
been shown by Grassman to exist if Newton’s theory
were true. He also gave a provisional diagram of
the curve formed by the spectrum, which ought to
take the place of the circle in Newton’s diagram;
for this, however, his experiments did not give the
complete data.</p>

<p>Such was the state of the question when Maxwell
began. His first colour-box was made in 1852.
Others were designed in 1855 and 1856, and the final
paper appeared in 1860. But before that time he
had established important results by means of his
rotatory discs and colour top. In his own description
of this he says: “The coloured paper is cut into the
form of disc, each with a hole in the centre and
divided along a radius so as to admit of several of
them being placed on the same axis, so that part of
each is exposed. By slipping one disc over another
we can expose any given portion of each colour.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
These discs are placed on a top or teetotum, which
is spun rapidly. The axis of the top passes through
the centre of the discs, and the quantity of each
colour exposed is measured by graduations on the
rim of the top, which is divided into 100 parts.
When the top is spun sufficiently rapidly, the
impressions due to each colour separately follow each
other in quick succession at each point of the retina,
and are blended together; the strength of the impression
due to each colour is, as can be shown
experimentally, the same as when the three kinds of
light in the same relative proportions enter the
eye simultaneously. These relative proportions are
measured by the areas of the various discs which
are exposed. Two sets of discs of different radius
are used; the largest discs are put on first, then the
smaller, so that the centre portion of the top shows
the colour arising from the mixture of those of the
smaller discs; the outer portion, that of the larger
discs.”</p>

<p>In experimenting, six discs of each size are used,
black, white, red, green, yellow and blue. It is found
by experiment that a match can be arranged between
any five of these. Thus three of the larger discs are
placed on the top—say black, yellow and blue—and
two of the smaller discs, red and green, are placed
above these. Then it is found that it is possible so
to adjust the amount exposed of each disc that the two
parts of the top appear when it is spun to be of the
same tint. In one series of experiments the chromatic
effect of 46·8 parts of black, 29·1 of yellow, and 24·1
of blue was found to be the same as that of 66·6 of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
red and 33·4 of green; each set of discs has a dirty
yellow tinge.</p>

<p>Now, in this experiment, black is not a colour;
practically no light reaches the eye from a dead
black. We have, however, to fill up the circumference
of the top in some way which will not affect the
impression on the retina arising from the mixture
of the blue and yellow; this we can do by using
the black disc.</p>

<p>Thus we have shown that 66·6 parts of red and
33·4 parts of green produce the same chromatic effect
as 29·1 of yellow and 24·1 of blue. Similarly in this
manner a match can be arranged between any four
colours and black, the black being necessary to
complete the circumference of the discs.</p>

<p>Thus using A, B, C, D to denote the various
colours, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i> the amounts of each colour taken,
we can get a series of results expressed as follows:
<i>a</i> parts of A together with <i>b</i> parts of B match <i>c</i> parts
of C together with <i>d</i> parts of D; or we may write this
as an equation <span class="locked">thus:—</span></p>

<p class="center"><i>a</i> A + <i>b</i> B = <i>c</i> C + <i>d</i> D,
</p>

<p class="in0">where the + stands for “combined with,” and the =
for “matches in tint.”</p>

<p>We may also write the <span class="locked">above—</span></p>

<p class="center"><i>d</i> D = <i>a</i> A + <i>b</i> B - <i>c</i> C,
</p>

<p class="in0">or <i>d</i> parts of D can be matched by a <em>proper</em> combination
of colours A, B, C. The sign - shows that in
order to make the match we have to combine the
colour C with D; the combination then matches
a mixture of A and B.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span></p>

<p>In this way we can form a number of equations
for all possible colours, and if we like to take any
three colours A, B, C as standards, we obtain a result
which may be written <span class="locked">generally—</span></p>

<p class="center"><i>x</i> X = <i>a</i> A + <i>b</i> B + <i>c</i> C,
</p>

<p class="in0">or <i>x</i> parts of X can be matched by <i>a</i> parts of A,
combined with <i>b</i> parts of B and <i>c</i> parts of C. If the
sign of one of the quantities <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, or <i>c</i> is negative, it
indicates that that colour must be combined with X
to match the other two.</p>

<p>Now Maxwell was able to show that, if A, B, C
be properly selected, nearly every other colour can
be matched by positive combinations of these
three. These three colours, then, are primary colours,
and nearly every other colour can be matched by a
combination of the three primary colours.</p>

<p>Experiments, however, with coloured discs, such
as were undertaken by Young, Forbes and Maxwell,
were not capable of giving satisfactory results. The
colours of the discs were not pure spectrum colours,
and varied to some extent with the nature of the
incident light. It was for this reason that Helmholtz
in 1852 experimented with the spectrum, and that
Maxwell about the same time invented his colour
box.</p>

<p>The principle of the latter was very simple. Suppose
we have a slit S, and some arrangement for
forming a pure spectrum on a screen. Let there
now be a slit R placed in the red part of the spectrum
on the screen. When light falls on the slit S, only
the red rays can reach R, and hence conversely, if the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
white source be placed at the other end of the apparatus,
so that R is illuminated with white light, only red
rays will reach S. Similarly, if another slit be placed
in the green at G, and this be illuminated by white
light, only the green rays will reach S, while from
a third slit V in the violet, violet light only can
arrive at S. Thus by opening the three slits at V,
G and R simultaneously, and looking through S, the
retina receives the impression of the three different
colours. The amount of light of each colour will
depend on the breadth to which the corresponding
slit is opened, and the relative intensities of the three
different components can be compared by comparing
the breadths of the three slits. Any other colour
which is allowed by some suitable contrivance to
enter the eye simultaneously can now be matched,
provided the red, green and violet are primary
colours.</p>

<p>By means of experiments with the colour box
Maxwell showed conclusively that a match could be
obtained between any four colours; the experiments
could not be carried out in quite the simple manner
suggested by the above description of the principle of
the box. An account of the method will be found in
Maxwell’s own paper. It consisted in matching a
standard white by various combinations of other
colours.</p>

<p>The main object of his research, however, was
to examine the chromatic properties of the different
parts of the spectrum, and to determine the form
of the curve which ought to replace the circle in
Newton’s diagram of colour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span></p>

<p>Maxwell adopted as his three standard colours:
red, of about wave length 6,302; green, wave length
5,281; and violet, 4,569 tenth metres. On the scale
of Maxwell’s instrument these are represented by the
numbers 24, 44 and 68.</p>

<p>Let us take three points A, B, C at the corners
of an equilateral triangle to represent on a diagram
these three colours. The position of any other colour
on the diagram will be found by taking weights
proportional to the amounts of the colours A, B, C
required to make the match between A, B, C and the
given colour; these weights are placed at A, B, C
respectively; the position of their centre of gravity
is the point required. Thus the position of white is
given by the <span class="locked">equation—</span></p>

<p class="center">W = 18·6 (24) + 31·4 (44) + 30·5 (68)
</p>

<p class="in0">which means that weights proportional to 18·6, 31·4
and 30·5 are to be placed at A, B, C respectively,
and their centre of gravity is to be found. The point
so found is the position of white. Any other colour
is given by the <span class="locked">equation—</span></p>

<p class="center">X = <i>a</i> (24) + <i>b</i> (44) + <i>c</i> (68).
</p>

<p>Again, the position on the diagram for all colours
for which <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i> are all positive lies within the
triangle A B C. If one of the coefficients, say <i>c</i>, is
negative the same construction applies, but the
weight applied at C must be treated as acting
in the opposite direction to those at A and B.
A mixture of the given colour and C matches a
mixture of A and B. It is clear that the point
corresponding to X will then lie outside the triangle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
A B C. Maxwell showed that, with his standards,
nearly all colours could be represented by points
inside the triangle. The colours he had selected
as standards were very close to primary colours.</p>

<p>Again, he proved that any spectrum colour between
red and green, when combined with a very slight
admixture of violet, could be matched, in the case
of either Mrs. Maxwell or himself, by a proper mixture
of the red and green. The positions, therefore,
of the spectrum colours between red and green lie
just outside the triangle A B C, being very close
to the line A B, while for the colours between green
and violet Maxwell obtained a curve lying rather
further outside the side B C. Any spectrum colour
between green and violet, together with a slight
admixture of red, can be matched by a proper mixture
of green and violet.</p>

<p>Thus the circle of Newton’s diagram should be
replaced by a curve, which coincides very nearly
with the two sides A B and B C of Maxwell’s figure.
Strictly, according to his observations, the curve lies
just outside these two sides. The purples of the
spectrum lie nearly along the third side, C A, of the
triangle, being obtained approximately by mixing
the violet and the red.</p>

<p>To find the point on the diagram corresponding
to the colour obtained by mixing any two or more
spectrum colours we must, in accordance with Newton’s
rule, place weights at the points corresponding
to the selected colours, and find the centre of gravity
of these weights.</p>

<p>This, then, was the outcome of Maxwell’s work on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
colour. It verified the essential part of Newton’s
construction, and obtained for the first time the true
form of the spectrum curve on the diagram.</p>

<p>The form of this curve will of course depend
on the eye of the individual observer. Thus Maxwell
and Mrs. Maxwell both made observations, and
distinct differences were found in their eyes. It
appears, however, that a large majority of persons
have normal vision, and that matches made by one
such person are accepted by most others as satisfactory.
Some people, however, are colour blind, and
Maxwell examined a few such. In the case of those
whom he examined it appeared as though vision was
dichromatic, the red sensation seemed to be absent;
nearly all colours could be matched by combinations
of green and violet. The colour diagram was reduced
to the straight line B C. Other forms of colour blindness
have since been investigated.</p>

<p>In awarding to Maxwell the Rumford medal in
1860, Major-General Sabine, vice-president of the
Royal Society, after explaining the theory of colour
vision and the possible method of verifying it, said:
“Professor Maxwell has subjected the theory to this
verification, and thereby raised the composition of
colours to the rank of a branch of mathematical
physics,” and he continues: “The researches for which
the Rumford medal is awarded lead to the remarkable
result that to a very near degree of approximation
all the colours of the spectrum, and therefore
all colours in nature which are only mixtures of these,
can be perfectly imitated by mixtures of three
actually attainable colours, which are the red, green<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
and blue belonging respectively to three particular
parts of the spectrum.”</p>

<p>It should be noticed in concluding our remarks
on this part of Maxwell’s work that his results are
purely physical. They are not inconsistent with the
physiological part of Young’s theory, viz., that there
are three primary sensations of colour which can be
transmitted to the brain, and that the colour of any
object depends on the relative proportions in which
these sensations are excited, but they do not prove
that theory. Any physiological theory which can be
accepted as true must explain Maxwell’s observations,
and Young’s theory does this; but it is, of course,
possible that other theories may explain them equally
well, and be more in accordance with physiological
observations than Young’s. Maxwell has given us
the physical facts which have to be explained; it is
for the physiologists to do the rest.</p>

<span class="subhead">SCIENTIFIC WORK—MOLECULAR THEORY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Maxwell</span> in his article “Atom,” in the ninth edition of
the <i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i>, has given some account
of Modern Molecular Science, and in particular of the
molecular theory of gases. Of this science, Clausius
and Maxwell are the founders, though to their names
it has recently been shown that a third, that of
Waterston, must be added. In the present chapter
it is intended to give an outline of Maxwell’s contributions
to molecular science, and to explain the
advances due to him.</p>

<p>The doctrine that bodies are composed of small
particles in rapid motion is very ancient. Democritus
was its founder, Lucretius—de Rerum Naturâ—explained
its principles. The atoms do not fill space;
there is void between.</p>

<p>According to Boscovitch an atom is an indivisible
point, having position in space, capable of motion, and
possessing mass. It is also endowed with the power
of exerting force, so that two atoms attract or repel
each other with a force depending on their distance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
apart. It has no parts or dimensions: it is a mere
geometrical point without extension in space; it has
not the property of impenetrability, for two atoms
can, it is supposed, exist at the same point.</p>

<p>In modern molecular science according to
Maxwell, “we begin by assuming that bodies are
made up of parts each of which is capable of motion,
and that these parts act on each other in a manner
consistent with the principle of the conservation of
energy. In making these assumptions we are
justified by the facts that bodies may be divided into
smaller parts, and that all bodies with which we are
acquainted are conservative systems, which would not
be the case unless their parts were also conservative
systems.</p>

<p>“We may also assume that these small parts are in
motion. This is the most general assumption we can
make, for it includes as a particular case the theory
that the small parts are at rest. The phenomena of
the diffusion of gases and liquids through each other
show that there may be a motion of the small parts of
a body which is not perceptible to us.</p>

<p>“We make no assumption with respect to the
nature of the small parts—whether they are all of
one magnitude. We do not even assume them to
have extension and figure. Each of them must be
measured by its mass, and any two of them must,
like visible bodies, have the power of acting on one
another when they come near enough to do so. The
properties of the body or medium are determined by
the configuration of its parts.”</p>

<p>These small particles are called molecules, and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
molecule in its physical aspect was defined by
Maxwell in the following <span class="locked">terms:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A molecule of a substance is a small body, such that if, on
the one hand, a number of similar molecules were assembled
together, they would form a mass of that substance; while on
the other hand, if any portion of this molecule were removed, it
would no longer be able, along with an assemblage of other
molecules similarly treated, to make up a mass of the original
substance.”</p>
</div>

<p>We are to look upon a gas as an assemblage of
molecules flying about in all directions. The path of
any molecule is a straight line, except during the
time when it is under the action of a neighbouring
molecule; this time is usually small compared with
that during which it is free.</p>

<p>The simplest theory we could formulate would be
that the molecules behaved like elastic spheres, and
that the action between any two was a collision following
the laws which we know apply to the collision of
elastic bodies. If the average distance between two
molecules be great compared with their dimensions,
the time during which any molecule is in collision
will be small compared with the interval between the
collisions, and this is in accordance with the fundamental
assumption just mentioned. It is not,
however, necessary to suppose an encounter between
two molecules to be a collision. One molecule may
act on another with a force, which depends on the
distance between them, of such a character that the
force is insensible except when the molecules are
extremely close together.</p>

<p>It is not difficult to see how the pressure exerted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
by a gas on the sides of a vessel which contains it
may be accounted for on this assumption. Each
molecule as it strikes the side has its momentum
reversed—the molecules are here assumed to be
perfectly elastic.</p>

<p>Thus each molecule of the gas is continually
gaining momentum from the sides of the vessel, while
it gives up to the vessel the momentum which it
possessed before the impact. The rate at which this
change of momentum proceeds across a given area
measures the force exerted on that area; the pressure
of the gas is the rate of change of momentum per
unit of area of the surface.</p>

<p>Again, it can be shown that this pressure is proportional
to the product of the mass of each molecule,
the number of molecules in a unit of volume, and
the square of the velocity of the molecules.</p>

<p>Let us consider in the first instance the case of a
jet of sand or water of unit cross section which is
playing against a surface. Suppose for the present
that all the molecules which strike the surface have
the same velocity.</p>

<p>Then the number of molecules which strike the
surface per second, will be proportional to this velocity.
If the particles are moving quickly they can reach the
surface in one second from a greater distance than is
possible if they be moving slowly. Again, the number
reaching the surface will be proportional to the
number of molecules per unit of volume. Hence, if
we call <i>v</i> the velocity of each particle, and N the
number of particles per unit of volume, the number
which strike the surface in one second will be N <i>v</i>;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
if <i>m</i> be the mass of each molecule, the mass which
strikes the surface per second is N <i>m</i> <i>v</i>; the velocity
of each particle of this mass is <i>v</i>, therefore the
momentum destroyed per second by the impact is
N <i>m</i> <i>v</i> × <i>v</i>, or N <i>m</i> <i>v</i>², and this measures the pressure.</p>

<p>Hence in this case if <i>p</i> be the pressure</p>

<p class="center"><i>p</i> = N <i>m</i> <i>v</i>².
</p>

<p>In the above we assume that <em>all</em> the molecules in
the jet are moving with velocity <i>v</i> perpendicular to
the surface. In the case of a crowd of molecules
flying about in a closed space this is clearly not true.
The molecules may strike the surface in any direction;
they will not all be moving normal to the surface.
To simplify the case, consider a cubical box filled
with gas. The box has three pairs of equal faces at
right angles. We may suppose one-third of the
particles to be moving at right angles to each face,
and in this case the number per unit volume which
we have to consider is not N, but ⅓ N. Hence the
formula becomes <i>p</i> = ⅓ N <i>m</i> <i>v</i>².</p>

<p>Moreover, if <i>ρ</i> be the density of the gas—that is,
the mass of unit volume—then N<i>m</i> is equal to <i>ρ</i>,
for <i>m</i> is the mass of each particle, and there are N
particles in a unit of volume.</p>

<p>Hence, finally, <i>p</i> = ⅓ <i>ρ</i> <i>v</i>².</p>

<p>Or, again, if V be the volume of unit mass of the
gas, then <i>ρ</i> V is unity, or ρ is equal to 1/V.</p>

<p>Hence <i>p</i>V = ⅓<i>v</i>².</p>

<p>Formulæ equivalent to these appear first to have
been obtained by Herapath about the year 1816
(Thomson’s “Annals of Philosophy,” 1816). The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
results only, however, were stated in that year. A
paper which attempted to establish them was presented
to the Royal Society in 1820. It gave rise to
very considerable correspondence, and was withdrawn
by the author before being read. It is printed in full
in Thomson’s “Annals of Philosophy” for 1821, vol. i.,
pp. 273, 340, 401. The arguments of the author are
no doubt open to criticism, and are in many points
far from sound. Still, by considering the problem of
the impact of a large number of hard bodies, he
arrived at a formula connecting the pressure and
volume of a given mass of gas equivalent to that
just given. These results are contained in Propositions
viii. and ix. of Herapath’s paper.</p>

<p>In his next step, however, Herapath, as we know
now, was wrong. One of his fundamental assumptions
is that the temperature of a gas is measured by the
momentum of each of its particles. Hence, assuming
this, we have T = <i>m</i> <i>v</i>, if T represents the temperature:
and</p>

<p class="center"><i>p</i> = ⅓ N <i>m</i> <i>v</i>² = ⅓ (N/<i>m</i>) (<i>m</i> <i>v</i>)².
</p>

<p class="in0">Or, <span class="locked">again—</span></p>

<p class="center"><i>p</i> = ⅓ N·T·<i>v</i> = ⅓·(N/<i>m</i>)·T².
</p>

<p class="in0">These results are practically given in Proposition viii.,
Corr. (1) and (2), and Proposition ix.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
temperature as thus defined by Herapath is an absolute
temperature, and he calculates the absolute zero of
temperature at which the gas would have no volume
from the above results. The actual calculation is of
course wrong, for, as we know now by experiment, the
pressure is proportional to the temperature, and not
to its square, as Herapath supposed. It will be seen,
however, that Herapath’s formula gives Boyle’s law;
for if the temperature is constant, the formula is
equivalent to</p>

<p class="center"><i>p</i> V = a constant.
</p>

<p>Herapath somewhat extended his work in his
“Mathematical Physics” published in 1847, and
applied his principles to explain diffusion, the relation
between specific heat and atomic weight, and other
properties of bodies. He still, however, retained his
erroneous supposition that temperature is to be
measured by the momentum of the individual
particles.</p>

<p>The next step in the theory was made by
Waterston. His paper was read to the Royal Society
on March 5th, 1846. It was most unfortunately
committed to the Archives of the Society, and was
only disinterred by Lord Rayleigh in 1892 and
printed in the Transactions for that year.</p>

<p>In the account just given of the theory, it has
been supposed that all the particles move with the
same velocity. This is clearly not the case in a gas.
If at starting all the particles had the same velocity,
the collisions would change this state of affairs. Some
particles will be moving quickly, some slowly. We may,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
however, still apply the theory by splitting up the
particles into groups, and, supposing that each group
has a constant velocity, the particles in this group
will contribute to the pressure an amount—<i>p</i>₁—equal
to ⅓ N₁ <i>m</i> <i>v</i>₁², where <i>v</i>₁ is the velocity of the group
and N₁ the number of particles having that velocity.
The whole pressure will be found by adding that due
to the various groups, and will be given as before by
<i>p</i> = ⅓ N <i>m</i> <i>v</i>², where <i>v</i> is not now the actual velocity
of the particles, but a mean velocity given by the
equation</p>

<p class="center">N <i>v</i>² = N₁ <i>v</i>₁² + N₂ <i>v</i>₂² + .....,
</p>

<p class="in0">which will produce the same pressure as arises from
the actual impacts. This quantity v² is known as the
<em>mean square</em> of the molecular velocity, and is so used
by Waterston.</p>

<p>In a paper in the <i>Philosophical Magazine</i> for
1858 Waterston gives an account of his own paper
of 1846 in the following terms:—“Mr. Herapath
unfortunately assumed heat or temperature to be
represented by the simple ratio of the velocity instead
of the square of the velocity, being in this apparently
led astray by the definition of motion generally received,
and thus was baffled in his attempts to
reconcile his theory with observation. If we make
this change in Mr. Herapath’s definition of heat or
temperature—viz., that it is proportional to the vis-viva
or square velocity of the moving particle, not to
the momentum or simple ratio of the velocity—we
can without much difficulty deduce not only the
primary laws of elastic fluids, but also the other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
physical properties of gases enumerated above in the
third objection to Newton’s hypothesis. [The paper
from which the quotation is taken is on ‘The Theory
of Sound.’] In the Archives of the Royal Society for
1845–46 there is a paper on ‘The Physics of Media
that consist of perfectly “Elastic Molecules in a
State of Motion,”’ which contains the synthetical
reasoning on which the demonstration of these
matters rests.... This theory does not take
account of the size of the molecules. It assumes
that no time is lost at the impact, and that if the
impacts produce rotatory motion, the vis viva thus
invested bears a constant ratio to the rectilineal vis
viva, so as not to require separate consideration. It
does, also, not take account of the probable internal
motion of composite molecules; yet the results so
closely accord with observation in every part of the
subject as to leave no doubt that Mr. Herapath’s idea
of the physical constitution of gases approximates
closely to the truth.”</p>

<p>In his introduction to Waterston’s paper (Phil.
Trans., 1892) Lord Rayleigh writes:—“Impressed
with the above passage, and with the general ingenuity
and soundness of Waterston’s views, I took
the first opportunity of consulting the Archives, and
saw at once that the memoir justified the large claims
made for it, and that it marks an immense advance
in the direction of the now generally received theory.”</p>

<p>In the first section of the paper Waterston’s great
advance consisted in the statement that the mean
square of the kinetic energy of each molecule
measures the temperature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span></p>

<p>According to this we are thus to put in the pressure
equation—½ <i>m</i> <i>v</i>² = T, the temperature, and we
have at once—<i>p</i> V = ⅔ N · T.</p>

<p>Now this equation expresses, as we know, the
laws of Boyle and Gay Lussac.</p>

<p>The second section discusses the properties of
media, consisting of two or more gases, and arrives at
the result that “in mixed media the mean square
molecular velocity is inversely proportional to the
specific weights of the molecules.” This was the
great law rediscovered by Maxwell fifteen years later.
With modern notation it may be put thus:—If
<i>m</i>₁, <i>m</i>₂ be the masses of each molecule of two different
sets of molecules mixed together, then, when
a steady state has been reached, since the temperature
is the same throughout, <i>m</i>₁ <i>v</i>₁² is equal to <i>m</i>₂ <i>v</i>₂². The
average kinetic energy of each molecule is the same.</p>

<p>From this Avogadros’ law follows at once—for if
<i>p</i>₁, <i>p</i>₂ be the pressures, N₁, N₂ the numbers of molecules
per unit <span class="locked">volume—</span></p>

<p class="center"><i>p</i>₁ = ⅓ N₁ <i>m</i>₁ <i>v</i>₁²,
<i>p</i>₂ = ⅓ N₂ <i>m</i>₂ <i>v</i>₂².
</p>

<p>Hence, if <i>p</i>₁, is equal to <i>p</i>₂, since <i>m</i>₁ <i>v</i>₁² is equal to
<i>m</i>₂ <i>v</i>₂², we must have N₁ equal to N₂, or the number
of molecules in equal volumes of two gases at the
same pressure and temperature is the same. The
proof of this proposition given by Waterston is not
satisfactory. On this point, however, we shall have
more to say. The third section of the paper deals with
adiabatic expansion, and in it there is an error in calculation
which prevented correct results from being attained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span></p>

<p>At the meeting of the British Association at
Ipswich, in 1851, a paper by J. J. Waterston of
Bombay, on “The General Theory of Gases,” was read.
The following is an extract from the <span class="locked">Proceedings:—</span></p>

<p>The author “conceives that the atoms of a gas,
being perfectly elastic, are in continual motion in all
directions, being constrained within a limited space
by their collisions with each other, and with the
particles of surrounding bodies.</p>

<p>“The vis viva of these motions in a given portion
of a gas constitutes the quantity of heat contained
in it.</p>

<p>“He shows that the result of this state of motion
must be to give the gas an elasticity proportional
to the mean square of the velocity of the molecular
motions, and to the total mass of the atoms contained
in unity of bulk” (unit of volume)—that is to say, to
the density of the medium.</p>

<p>“The elasticity in a given gas is the measure
of temperature. Equilibrium of pressure and heat
between two gases takes place when the number
of atoms in unit of volume is equal and the vis
viva of each atom equal. Temperature, therefore,
in all gases is proportional to the mass of one atom
multiplied by the mean square of the velocity of the
molecular motions, being measured from an absolute
zero 491° below the zero of Fahrenheit’s thermometer.”</p>

<p>It appears, therefore, from these extracts that the
discovery of the laws that temperature is measured by
the mean kinetic energy of a single molecule, and
that in a mixture of gases the mean kinetic energy of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
each molecule is the same for each gas, is due to
Waterston. They were contained in his paper of
1846, and published by him in 1851. Both these
papers, however, appear to have been unnoticed by
all subsequent writers until 1892.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in 1848, Joule’s attention was called
by his experiments to the question, and he saw that
Herapath’s result gave a means of calculating the
mean velocity of the molecules of a gas. For according
to the result given above, <i>p</i> = ⅓ <i>ρ v</i>²; thus
<i>v</i>² = 3 <i>p/ρ</i>, and <i>p</i> and <i>ρ</i> being known, we find <i>v</i>². Thus
for hydrogen at freezing-point and atmospheric pressure
Joule obtains for <i>v</i> the value 6,055 feet per second,
or, roughly, six times the velocity of sound in air.</p>

<p>Clausius was the next writer of importance on the
subject. His first paper is in “Poggendorff’s Annalen,”
vol. c., 1857, “On the Kind of Motion we call
Heat.” It gives an exposition of the theory, and
establishes the fact that the kinetic energy of the
translatory motion of a molecule does not represent
the whole of the heat it contains. If we look upon
a molecule as a small solid we must consider the
energy it possesses in consequence of its rotation
about its centre of gravity, as well as the energy due
to the motion of translation of the whole.</p>

<p>Clausius’ second paper appeared in 1859. In it
he considers the average length of the path of a
molecule during the interval between two collisions.
He determines this path in terms of the average
distance between the molecules and the distance
between the centres of two molecules at the time
when a collision is taking place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span></p>

<p>These two papers appear to have attracted Maxwell’s
attention to the matter, and his first paper,
entitled “Illustrations of the Dynamical Theory of
Gases,” was read to the British Association at Aberdeen
and Oxford in 1859 and 1860, and appeared in
the <i>Philosophical Magazine</i>, January and July, 1860.</p>

<p>In the introduction to this paper Maxwell points
out, while there was then no means of measuring the
quantities which occurred in Clausius’ expression for
the mean free path, “the phenomena of the internal
friction of gases, the conduction of heat through a gas,
and the diffusion of one gas through another, seem to
indicate the possibility of determining accurately the
mean length of path which a particle describes between
two collisions. In order, therefore, to lay the foundation
of such investigations on strict mechanical principles,”
he continues, “I shall demonstrate the laws
of motion of an indefinite number of small, hard and
perfectly elastic spheres acting on one another only
during impact.”</p>

<p>Maxwell then proceeds to consider in the first case
the impact of two spheres.</p>

<p>But a gas consists of an indefinite number of
molecules. Now it is impossible to deal with each
molecule individually, to trace its history and follow
its path. In order, therefore, to avoid this difficulty
Maxwell introduced the statistical method of dealing
with such problems, and this introduction is the first
great step in molecular theory with which his name
is connected.</p>

<p>He was led to this method by his investigation
into the theory of Saturn’s rings, which had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
completed in 1856, and in which he had shown that the
conditions of stability required the supposition that
the rings are composed of an indefinite number of free
particles revolving round the planet, with velocities
depending on their distances from the centre. These
particles may either be arranged in separate rings, or
their motion may be such that they are continually
coming into collision with each other.</p>

<p>As an example of the statistical method, let us
consider a crowd of people moving along a street.
Taken as a whole the crowd moves steadily forwards.
Any individual in the crowd, however, is jostled backwards
and forwards and from side to side; if a line
were drawn across the street we should find people
crossing it in both directions. In a considerable interval
more people would cross it, going in the direction
in which the crowd is moving, than in the other,
and the velocity of the crowd might be estimated
by counting the number which crossed the line in
a given interval. This velocity so found would differ
greatly from the velocity of any individual, which
might have any value within limits, and which is
continually changing. If we knew the velocity of
each individual and the number of individuals we
could calculate the average velocity, and this would
agree with the value found by counting the resultant
number of people who cross the line in a given interval.</p>

<p>Again, the people in the crowd will naturally fall
into groups according to their velocities. At any
moment there will be a certain number of people
whose velocities are all practically equal, or, to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
more accurate, do not differ among themselves by
more than some small quantity. The number of
people at any moment in each of these groups will
be very different. The number in any group, which
has a velocity not differing greatly from the mean
velocity of the whole, will be large; comparatively few
will have either a very large or a very small velocity.</p>

<p>Again, at any moment, individuals are changing
from one group to another; a man is brought to
a stop by some obstruction, and his velocity is considerably
altered—he passes from one group to a
different one; but while this is so, if the mean velocity
remains constant, and the size of the crowd be very
great, the number of people at any moment in a
given group remains unchanged. People pass from
that group into others, but during any interval the
same number pass back again into that group.</p>

<p>It is clear that if this condition is satisfied the
distribution is a steady one, and the crowd will continue
to move on with the same uniform mean velocity.</p>

<p>Now, Maxwell applies these considerations to a
crowd of perfectly elastic spheres, moving anyhow in
a closed space, acting upon each other only when
in contact. He shows that they may be divided into
groups according to their velocities, and that, when
the steady state is reached, the number in each group
will remain the same, although the individuals change.
Moreover, it is shown that, if A and B represent any
two groups, the state will only be steady when the
numbers which pass from the group A to the group
B are equal to the numbers which pass back from the
group B to the group A. This condition, combined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
with the fact that the total kinetic energy of the
motion remains unchanged, enables him to calculate
the number of particles in any group in terms of the
whole number of particles, the mean velocity, and the
actual velocity of the group.</p>

<p>From this an accurate expression can be found for
the pressure of the gas, and it is proved that the value
found by others, on the assumption that all the
particles were moving with a common velocity, is
correct. Previous to this paper of Maxwell’s it had
been realised that the velocities could not be uniform
throughout. There had been no attempt to determine
the distribution of velocity, or to submit the problem
to calculation, making allowance for the variations in
velocity.</p>

<p>Maxwell’s mathematical methods are, in their
generality and elegance, far in advance of anything
previously attempted in the subject.</p>

<p>So far it has been assumed that the particles in the
vessel are all alike. Maxwell next takes the case of
a mixture of two kinds of particles, and inquires what
relation must exist between the average velocities of
these different particles, in order that the state may
be steady.</p>

<p>Now, it can be shown that when two elastic spheres
impinge the effect of the impact is always such as to
reduce the difference between their kinetic energies.</p>

<p>Hence, after a very large number of impacts the
kinetic energies of the two balls must be the same;
the steady state, then, will be reached when each ball
has the same kinetic energy.</p>

<p>Thus if <i>m</i>₁, <i>m</i>₂ be the masses of the particles in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
the two sets respectively, <i>v</i>₁, <i>v</i>₂ their mean velocities
we must have <span class="locked">finally—</span></p>

<p class="center">½ <i>m</i>₁ <i>v</i>₁² = ½ <i>m</i>₂ <i>v</i>₂²
</p>

<p>This is the second of the two great laws enunciated
by Waterston in 1845 and 1851, but which, as we
have seen, had remained unknown until 1859, when
it was again given by Maxwell.</p>

<p>Now, when gases are mixed their temperatures
become equal. Hence we conclude, in Maxwell’s
words, “that the physical condition which determines
that the temperature of two gases shall be the same,
is that the mean kinetic energy of agitation of the
individual molecules of the two gases are equal.”</p>

<p>Thus, as the result of Maxwell’s more exact researches
on the motion of a system of spherical
particles, we find that we again can obtain the
<span class="locked">equations—</span></p>

<p class="center">T = ½ <i>mv</i>²
<i>p</i> = ⅓ N <i>mv</i>² = ⅔ NT = ⅔ <i>ρ</i> T/<i>m</i>
</p>

<p>From these results we obtain as before the laws of
Boyle, Charles and Avrogadro.</p>

<p>Again if <i>σ</i> be the specific heat of the gas at
constant volume, the quantity of heat required to
raise a single molecule of mass <i>m</i> one degree will be
<i>σ</i> <i>m</i>.</p>

<p>Thus, when a molecule is heated, the kinetic
energy must increase by this amount. But the
increase of temperature, which in this case is 1°, is
measured by the increase of kinetic energy of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
single molecule. Hence the amount of heat required
to raise the temperature of a single molecule of all
gases 1° is the same. Thus the quantity <i>σ</i> <i>m</i> is
the same for all gases; or, in other words, the
specific heat of a gas is inversely proportional to the
mass of its individual molecules. The density of a
gas—since the number of molecules per unit volume
at a given pressure and temperature is the same for
all gases—is also proportional to the mass of each individual
molecule. Thus the specific heats of all gases
are inversely proportional to their densities. This
is the law discovered experimentally by Dulong and
Petit to be approximately true for a large number of
substances.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>In the next part of the paper Maxwell proceeded
to determine the average number of collisions in a
given time, and hence, knowing the velocities, to
determine, in terms of the size of the particles and
their numbers, the mean free path of a particle; the
result so found differed somewhat from that already
obtained by Clausius.</p>

<p>Having done this he showed how, by means of
experiments on the viscosity of gases, the length of
the mean free path could be determined.</p>

<p>An illustration due to Professor Balfour Stewart
will perhaps make this clear. Let us suppose we
have two trains running with uniform speed in
opposite directions on parallel lines, and, further, that
the engines continue to work at the same rate,
developing just sufficient energy to overcome the
resistance of the line, etc., and to maintain the speed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
constant. Now suppose passengers commence to
jump across from one train to the other. Each man
carries with him his own momentum, which is in the
opposite direction to that of the train into which he
jumps; the result is that the momentum of each
train is reduced by the process; the velocities of the
two decrease; it appears as though a frictional force
were acting between the two. Maxwell suggests that
a similar process will account for the apparent
viscosity of gases.</p>

<p>Consider two streams of gas, moving in opposite
directions one over the other; it is found that in
each case the layers of gas near the separating surface
move more slowly than those in the interior of
the streams; there is apparently a frictional force
between the two streams along this surface, tending
to reduce their relative velocity. Maxwell’s explanation
of this is that at the common surface particles
from the one stream enter the other, and carry with
them their own momentum; thus near this surface
the momentum of each stream is reduced, just as the
momentum of the trains is reduced by the people
jumping across. Internal friction or viscosity is due
to the diffusion of momentum across this common
surface. The effect does not penetrate far into the
gas, for the particles soon acquire the velocity of the
stream to which they have come.</p>

<p>Now, the rate at which the momentum is diffused
will measure the frictional force, and will depend on
the mean free path of the particles. If this is considerable,
so that on the average a particle can penetrate a
considerable distance into the second gas before a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
collision takes place and its motion is changed, the
viscosity will be considerable; if, on the other hand,
the mean free path is small, the reverse will be true.
Thus it is possible to obtain a relation between
the mean free path and the coefficient of viscosity,
and from this, if the coefficient of viscosity be known,
a value for the mean free path can be found.</p>

<p>Maxwell, in the paper under discussion, was the
first to do this, and, using a value found by Professor
Stokes for the coefficient of viscosity, obtained as the
length of the mean free path of molecules of air
1/447000 of an inch, while the number of collisions per
second experienced by each molecule is found to be
about 8,077,200,000.</p>

<p>Moreover, it appeared from his theory that the coefficient
of viscosity should be independent of the
number of molecules of gas present, so that it is not
altered by varying the density. This result Maxwell
characterises as startling, and he instituted an elaborate
series of experiments a few years later with a view of
testing it. The reason for this result will appear if
we remember that, when the density is decreased, the
mean free path is increased; relatively, then, to the
total number of molecules present, the number which
cross the surface in a given time is increased. And it
appears from Maxwell’s result that this relative increase
is such that the total number crossing remains
unchanged. Hence the momentum conveyed across
each unit area per second remains the same, in spite
of the decrease in density.</p>

<p>Another consequence of the same investigation is
that the coefficient of viscosity is proportional to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
mean velocity of the molecules. Since the absolute
temperature is proportional to the square of the
velocity, it follows that the coefficient of viscosity is
proportional to the square root of the absolute
temperature.</p>

<p>The second part of the paper deals with the
process of diffusion of two or more kinds of moving
particles among one another.</p>

<p>If two different gases are placed in two vessels
separated by a porous diaphragm such as a piece of
unglazed earthenware, or connected by means of a
narrow tube, Graham had shewn that, after sufficient
time has elapsed, the two are mixed together.
The same process takes place when two gases
of different density are placed together in the same
vessel. At first the denser gas may be at the bottom,
the less dense above, but after a time the two are
found to be uniformly distributed throughout.</p>

<p>Maxwell attempted to calculate from his theory
the rate at which the diffusion takes place in these
cases. The conditions of most of Graham’s experiments
were too complicated to admit of direct comparison
with the theory, from which it appeared that
there is a relation between the mean free path and
the rate of diffusion. One experiment, however, was
found, the conditions of which could be made the
subject of calculation, and from it Maxwell obtained
as the value of the mean free path in air 1/389000 of an
inch.</p>

<p>The number was close enough to that found from
the viscosity to afford some confirmation of his
theory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span></p>

<p>However, a few years later Clausius criticised the
details of this part of the paper, and Maxwell, in his
memoir of 1866, admits the calculation to have been
erroneous. The main principles remained unaffected,
the molecules pass from one gas to the other, and this
constitutes diffusion.</p>

<p>Now, suppose we have two sets of particles in
contact of such a nature that the mean kinetic
energy of the one set is different from that of the
other; the temperatures of the two will then be different.
These two sets will diffuse into each other, and
the diffusing particles will carry with them their
kinetic energy, which will gradually pass from those
which have the greater energy to those which have
the less, until the average kinetic energy is equalised
throughout. But the kinetic energy of translation is
the heat of the particles. This diffusion of kinetic
energy is a diffusion of heat by conduction, and we
have here the mechanical theory of the conduction
of heat in a gas.</p>

<p>Maxwell obtained an expression, which, however,
he afterwards modified, for the conductivity of a gas
in terms of the mean free path. It followed from this
that the conductivity of air was only about 1/7000 of
that of copper.</p>

<p>Thus the diffusion of gases, the viscosity of gases,
and the conduction of heat in gases, are all connected
with the diffusion of the particles carrying with them
their momenta and their energy; while values of the
mean free path can be obtained from observations on
any one of these properties.</p>

<p>In the third part of his paper Maxwell considers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
the consequences of supposing the particles not to be
spherical. In this case the impacts would tend to set
up a motion of rotation in the particles. The direction
of the force acting on any particle at impact would
not necessarily pass through its centre; thus by impact
the velocity of its centre would be changed, and in
addition the particles would be made to spin. Some
part, therefore, of the energy of the particles will
appear in the form of the translational energy
of their centres, while the rest will take the
form of rotational energy of each particle about
its centre.</p>

<p>It follows from Maxwell’s work that for each particle
the average value of these two portions of energy
would be equal. The total energy will be half translational
and half rotational.</p>

<p>This theorem, in a more general form which was
afterwards given to it, has led to much discussion,
and will be again considered later. For the present
we will assume it to be true. Clausius had already
called attention to the fact that some of the energy
must be rotational unless the molecules be smooth
spheres, and had given some reasons for supposing
that the ratio of the whole energy to the energy
of translation is in a steady state a constant. Maxwell
shows that for rigid bodies this constant is 2.
Let us denote it for the present by the symbol β.
Thus, if the translational energy of a molecule is
½ <i>m</i> <i>v</i>², its whole energy is ½ β <i>m</i> <i>v</i>².</p>

<p>The temperature is still measured by the translational
energy, or ½ <i>m</i> <i>v</i>²; the heat depends on the
whole energy. Hence if H represent the amount of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
heat—measured as energy—contained by a single
molecule, and T its temperature, we <span class="locked">have—</span></p>

<p class="center">H = βT
</p>

<p>From this it can be shewn<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> that if γ represent the
ratio of the specific heat of a gas at constant pressure
to the specific heat at constant volume, <span class="locked">then—</span></p>

<p class="center">β = ⅔ 1/(γ-1)
</p>

<p>For air and some other gases the value of γ has
been shown to be 1·408. From this it follows that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
β = 1·634. Now, Maxwell’s theory required that for
smooth hard particles, approximately spherical in
shape, β should be 2, and hence he concludes “we
have shown that a system of such particles could not
possibly satisfy the known relation between the two
specific heats of all gases.”</p>

<p>Since this statement was made many more experiments
on the value of γ have been undertaken; it is
not equal to 1·408 for <i>all</i> gases. Hence the value of
β is different for various gases.</p>

<p>It is of some importance to notice that the
value of β just found for air is very approximately
1·66 or 5/3.</p>

<p>For mercury vapour the value of γ has been shown
by Kundt to be 1·33 or 1⅓, and hence β is equal to 1.
Thus all the energy of a particle of mercury vapour is
translational, and its behaviour in this respect is consistent
with the assumption that a particle of mercury
vapour is a smooth sphere.</p>

<p>The two results of this theory which seemed to
lend themselves most readily to experimental verification
were (1) that the viscosity of a gas is
independent of its density, and (2) that it is proportional
to the square root of the absolute
temperature. The next piece of work connected with
the theory was an attempt to test these consequences,
and a description of the experiments was published
in the “Philosophical Transactions” for 1865, in a
paper on the “Viscosity or Internal Friction of Air
and other Gases,” and forms the Bakerian lecture for
that year.</p>

<p>The first result was completely proved. It is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
shewn that the value of the coefficient<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> of viscosity
“is the same for air at 0·5 inch and at 30 inches
pressure, provided that the temperature remains the
same.”</p>

<p>It was clear also that the viscosity depended on
the temperature, and the results of the experiments
seemed to show that it was nearly proportional to the
absolute temperature. Thus for two temperatures,
185° Fah. and 51° Fah., the ratio of the two coefficients
found was 1·2624; the ratio of the two
temperatures, each measured from absolute zero, is
1·2605.</p>

<p>This result, then, does not agree with the hypothesis
that a gas consists of spherical molecules acting only
on each other by a kind of impact, for, if this were so,
the coefficient would, as we have seen, depend on the
square root of the absolute temperature. But Maxwell’s
result, connecting viscosity with the first power
of the absolute temperature, has not been confirmed
by other investigators. According to it we should
have as the relation between μ, the coefficient of
viscosity at t° and μ₀, that at zero the <span class="locked">equation—</span></p>

<p class="center">μ = μ₀ (1 + .00365 t).
</p>

<p>The most recent results of Professor Holman
(<i>Philosophical Magazine</i>, Vol. xxi., p. 212) <span class="locked">give—</span></p>

<p class="center">μ = μ₀ (1 + .00275 t - .00000034 t²).
</p>

<p class="in0">And results similar to this are given by O. E. Meyer,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
Puluj, and Obermeyer. Maxwell’s coefficient ·00365
is too large, but ·00182, the coefficient obtained by
supposing the viscosity proportional to the square
root of the temperature, would be too small.</p>

<p>It still remains true, therefore, that the laws of the
viscosity of gases cannot be explained by the hypothesis
of the impact of hard spheres; but some deductions
drawn by Maxwell in his next paper from his supposed
law of proportionality to the first power of the
absolute temperature require modification.</p>

<p>It was clear from his experiments just described
that the simple hypothesis of the impact of elastic
bodies would not account for all the phenomena
observed. Accordingly, in 1866, Maxwell took up
the problem in a more general form in his paper on
the “Dynamical Theory of Gases,” Phil. Trans., 1866.</p>

<p>In it he considered the molecules of the gas not
as elastic spheres of definite radius, but as small
bodies, or groups of smaller molecules, repelling one
another with a force whose direction always passes
very nearly through the centre of gravity of the
molecules, and whose magnitude is represented very
nearly by some function of the distance of the centres
of gravity. “I have made,” he continues, “this
modification of the theory in consequence of the
results of my experiments on the viscosity of air at
different temperatures, and I have deduced from
these experiments that the repulsion is inversely as
the fifth power of the distance.”</p>

<p>Since more recent observation has shown that the
numerical results of Maxwell’s work connecting
viscosity and temperature are erroneous, this last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
deduction does not hold; the inverse fifth power law
of force will not give the correct relation between
viscosity and temperature. Maxwell himself at a
later date, “On the Stresses in Rarefied Gases,” Phil.
Trans., 1879, realised this; but even in this last paper
he adhered to the fifth power law because it leads to
an important simplification in the equations to be
dealt with.</p>

<p>The paper of 1866 is chiefly important because it
contains for the first time the application of general
dynamical methods to molecular problems. The law
of the distribution of velocities among the molecules
is again investigated, and a result practically identical
with that found for the elastic spheres is arrived at.
In obtaining this conclusion, however, it is assumed
that the distribution of velocities is uniform in all
directions about any point, whatever actions may be
taking place in the gas. If, for example, the temperature
is different at different points, then, for a given
velocity, all directions are not equally probable.
Maxwell’s expression, therefore, for the number of
molecules which at any moment have a given velocity
only applies to the permanent state in which the distribution
of temperature is uniform. When dealing,
for example, with the conduction of heat, a modification
of the expression is necessary. This was
pointed out by Boltzmann.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a></p>

<p>In the paper of 1866, Maxwell applies his generalised
results to the final distribution of two gases<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
under the action of gravity, the equilibrium of temperature
between two gases, and the distribution of
temperature in a vertical column. These results are,
as he states, independent of the law of force between
the molecules. The dynamical causes of diffusion
viscosity and conduction of heat are dealt with, and
these involve the law of force.</p>

<p>It follows also from the investigation that, on the
hypotheses assumed as its basis, if two kinds of gases
be mixed, the difference between the average kinetic
energies of translation of the gases of each kind
diminishes rapidly in consequence of the action
between the two. The average kinetic energy of
translation, therefore, tends to become the same for
each kind of gas, and as before, it is this average
energy of translation which measures the temperature.</p>

<p>A molecule in the theory is a portion of a gas
which moves about as a single body. It may be a
mere point, a centre of force having inertia, capable
of doing work while losing velocity. There may
be also in each molecule systems of several such
centres of force bound together by their mutual
actions. Again, a molecule may be a small solid
body of determinate form; but in this case we must,
as Maxwell points out, introduce a new set of forces
binding together the parts of each molecule: we must
have a molecular theory of the second order. In any
case, the most general supposition made is that a
molecule consists of a series of parts which stick
together, but are capable of relative motion among
each other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span></p>

<p>In this case the kinetic energy of the molecule
consists of the energy of its centre of gravity, together
with the energy of its component parts, relative to its
centre of gravity.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a></p>

<p>Now Clausius had, as we have seen, given reasons
for believing that the ratio of the whole energy of a
molecule to the energy of translation of its centre of
gravity tends to become constant. We have already
used β to denote this constant. Thus, while the temperature
is measured by the average kinetic energy
of translation of the centre of gravity of each molecule,
the heat contained in a molecule is its whole
energy, and is β times this quantity. Thus the conclusions
as to specific heat, etc., already given on page
130, apply in this case, and in particular we have the
result that if γ be the ratio of the specific heat at
constant pressure to that at constant volume, <span class="locked">then—</span></p>

<p class="center">β = ⅔ 1/(γ-1)
</p>

<p class="in0">Maxwell’s theorem of the distribution of kinetic
energy among a system of molecules applied, as he
gave it in 1866, to the kinetic energy of translation of
the centre of gravity of each molecule. Two years
later Dr. Boltzmann, in the paper we have already<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
referred to, extended it (under certain limitations) to
the parts of which a molecule is composed. According
to Maxwell the average kinetic energy of the centre
of gravity of each molecule tends to become the same.
According to Boltzmann the average kinetic energy
of each part of the molecule tends to become the
same.</p>

<p>Maxwell, in the last paper he wrote on the subject
(“On Boltzmann’s Theorem on the Average Distribution
of Energy in a System of Material Points,”
Camb. Phil. Trans., XII.), took up this problem.
Watson had given a proof of it in 1876 differing from
Boltzmann’s, but still limited by the stipulation that
the time, during which a particle is encountering other
particles, is very small compared with the time during
which there is no sensible action between it and other
particles, and also that the time during which a
particle is simultaneously within the distance of more
than one other particle may be neglected.</p>

<p>Maxwell claims that his proof is free from any
such limitation. The material points may act on
each other at all distances, and according to any law
which is consistent with the conservation of energy;
they may also be acted on by forces external to the
system, provided these are consistent with that law.</p>

<p>The only assumption which is necessary for the
direct proof is that the system, if left to itself in its
actual state of motion, will sooner or later pass
through every phase which is consistent with the
conservation of energy.</p>

<p>In this paper Maxwell finds in a very general
manner an expression for the number of molecules<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
which at any time have a given velocity, and this,
when simplified by the assumptions of the former
papers, reduces to the form already found. He also
shows that the average kinetic energy corresponding
to any one of the variables which define his system
is the same for every one of the variables of his system.</p>

<p>Thus, according to this theorem, if each molecule
be a single small solid body, six variables will be required
to determine the position of each, three
variables will give us the position of the centre of
gravity of the molecule, while three others will determine
the position of the body relative to its centre of
gravity. If the six variables be properly chosen, the
kinetic energy can be expressed as a sum of six
squares, one square corresponding to each variable.
According to the theorem the part of the kinetic
energy depending on each square is the same. Thus,
the whole energy is six times as great as that which
arises from any one of the variables. The kinetic
energy of translation is three times as great as that
arising from each variable, for it involves the three
variables which determine the position of the centre
of gravity. Hence, if we denote by K the kinetic
energy due to one variable, the whole energy is 6 K,
and the translational energy is 3 K; thus, for this
<span class="locked">case—</span></p>

<p class="center">β = 6K/3K = 2
</p>

<p class="in0">Or, again, if we suppose that the molecule is such that
<i>m</i> variables are required to determine its position
relatively to its centre of gravity, since 3 are
needed to fix the centre of gravity, the total number<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
of variables defining the position of the molecule is
<i>m</i> + 3, and it is said to have <i>m</i> + 3 degrees of freedom.
Hence, in this case, its total energy is (<i>m</i> + 3) K and
its energy of translation is 3 K, thus we <span class="locked">find—</span></p>

<p class="center">β = (<i>m</i> + 3)/3</p>

<p class="center">Hence <span class="in2">γ = 1 + 2/(<i>m</i> + 3) = 1 + 2/<i>n</i></span>
</p>

<p class="in0">if <i>n</i> be the number of degrees of freedom of the
molecule.</p>

<p>Thus, if this Boltzmann-Maxwell theorem be true,
the specific heat of a gas will depend solely on the
number of degrees of freedom of each of its molecules.
For hard rigid bodies we should have <i>n</i> equal to 6,
and hence γ = 1·333. Now the fact that this is not
the value of γ for any of the known gases is a
fundamental difficulty in the way of accepting the
complete theory.</p>

<p>Boltzmann has called attention to the fact that if
<i>n</i> be equal to five, then γ has the value 1·40. And this
agrees fairly with the value found by experiment for
air, oxygen, nitrogen, and various other gases. We
will, however, return to this point shortly.</p>

<p>There is, perhaps, no result in the domain of
physical science in recent years which has been more
discussed than the two fundamental theorems of the
molecular theory which we owe to Maxwell and to
Boltzmann.</p>

<p>The two results in question are (1) the expression
for the number of molecules which at any moment
will have a given velocity, and (2) the proposition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
that the kinetic energy is ultimately equally divided
among all the variables which determine the system.</p>

<p>With regard to (1) Maxwell showed that his error
law was one possible condition of permanence. If at
any moment the velocities are distributed according
to the error law, that distribution will be a permanent
one. He did not prove that such a distribution is the
only one which can satisfy all the conditions of the
problem.</p>

<p>The proof that this law is a necessary, as well as a
sufficient, condition of permanence was first given by
Boltzmann, for a single monatomic gas in 1872, for a
mixture of such gases in 1886, and for a polyatomic gas
in 1887. Other proofs have been given since by Watson
and Burbury. It would be quite beyond the limits of
this book to go into the question of the completeness
or sufficiency of the proofs. The discussion of the
question is still in progress.</p>

<p>The British Association Report for 1894 contains
an important contribution to the question, in the
shape of a report by Mr. G. H. Bryan, and the discussion
he started at Oxford by reading this report
has been continued in the pages of <i>Nature</i> and elsewhere
since that time.</p>

<p>Mr. Bryan shows in the first place what may be
the nature of the systems of molecules to which the
results will apply, and discusses various points of
difficulty in the proof.</p>

<p>The theorem in question, from which the result (1)
follows as a simple deduction, has been thus stated by
Dr. Larmor.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span></p>

<p>“There exists a positive function belonging to a
group of molecules which, as they settle themselves
into a steady state—on the average derived from a
great number of configurations—maintains a steady
downward trend. The Maxwell-Boltzmann steady state
is the one in which this function has finally attained
its minimum value, and is thus a unique steady state,
it still being borne in mind that this is only a proposition
of averages derived from a great number of
instances in which nothing is conserved in encounters,
except the energy, and that exceptional circumstances
may exist, comparatively very few in number, in
which the trend is, at any rate, temporarily the
other way.”</p>

<p>This theorem, when applied to cases of motion,
such as that of a gas at constant temperature enclosed
in a rigid envelope impermeable to heat,
appears to be proved. For such a case, therefore,
the Maxwell-Boltzmann law is the only one possible.</p>

<p>But whether this be so or not, the law first introduced
by Maxwell is one of those possible, and the
advance in molecular science due to its introduction
is enormous.</p>

<p>We come now to the second result, the equal
partition of the energy among all the degrees of
freedom of each molecule. Lord Kelvin has pointed
out a flaw in Maxwell’s proof, but Boltzmann showed
(<i>Philosophical Magazine</i>, March, 1893) how this flaw
can easily be corrected, and it may be said that in all
cases in which the Boltzmann-Maxwell law of the
distribution of velocities holds, Maxwell’s law of the
equal partition of energy holds also.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span></p>

<p>Three cases are considered by Mr. Bryan, in which
the law of distribution fails for rigid molecules: the
first is when the molecules have all, in addition to
their velocities of agitation, a common velocity of
translation in a fixed direction; the second is when the
gas has a motion of uniform rotation about a fixed
axis; while the third is when each molecule has an
axis of symmetry. In this last case the forces acting
during a collision necessarily pass through the axis
of symmetry, the angular velocity, therefore, of any
molecule about this axis remains constant, the
number of molecules having a given angular velocity
will remain the same throughout the motion, and the
part of the kinetic energy which depends on this
component of the motion will remain fixed, and will
not come into consideration when dealing with the
equal partition of the energy among the various
degrees of freedom.</p>

<p>Such a molecule has five, and not six, degrees of
freedom; three quantities are needed to determine the
position of its centre of gravity, and two to fix the
position of the axis of symmetry.</p>

<p>In this case, then, as Boltzmann points out, in the
expression for the ratio of the specific heats, we must
have <i>n</i> equal to 5, and hence</p>

<p class="center">γ = 1 + 2/<i>n</i> = 1 + 2/5 = 1·4
</p>

<p class="in0">agreeing fairly with the value found for air and
various other permanent gases.</p>

<p>For cases, then, in which we consider each atom
as a single rigid body, the Boltzmann-Maxwell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
theorem appears to give a unique solution, and the
Maxwell law of the distribution of the energy to be
in fair accordance with the results of observation.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a></p>

<p>If we can never go further—and it must be
admitted that the difficulties in the way of further
advance are enormous—it may, I think, be claimed
for Maxwell that the progress already made is greatly
due to him. Both these laws, for the case of elastic
spheres, are contained in his first paper of 1860;
and while it is to the genius of Boltzmann that we owe
their earliest generalisation, and in particular the
proof of the uniqueness of the solution under proper
restrictions, Maxwell’s last paper contributed in no
small degree to the security of the position. Not
merely the foundations, but much of the superstructure
of molecular science is his work.</p>

<p>The difficulties in the way of advance are, as we
have said, enormous. Boltzmann, in one of his papers,
has considered the properties of a complex molecule
of a gas, consisting maybe of a number of atoms
and possibly of ether atoms bound with them, and he
concludes that such a molecule will behave in its
progressive motion, and in its collisions with other
molecules, nearly like a rigid body. But to quote
from Mr. Bryan: “The case of a polyatomic molecule,
whose atoms are capable of vibrating relative
to one another, affords an interesting field for investigation
and speculation. Is the Boltzmann distribution
still unique, or do other permanent distributions
exist in which the kinetic energy is unequally
divided?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span></p>

<p>Again, the spectroscope reveals to us vibrations
of the ether, which are connected in some way with
the vibrations of the molecules of gas, whose spectrum
we are observing. It seems clear that the law of
equal partition does not apply to these, and yet,
if we are to suppose that the ether vibrations are
due to actual vibrations of the atoms which constitute
a molecule, why does it not apply? Where
does the condition come in which leads to failure in
the proof? Or, again, is it, as has been suggested, the
fact that the complex spectrum of a gas represents
the terms of a Fourier Series, into which some
elaborate vibration of the atoms is resolved by the
ether? or is the spectrum due simply to electro-magnetic
vibrations on the surface of the molecules—vibrations
whose period is determined chiefly by the
size and shape of the molecule, but in which the
atoms of which it is composed take part? There are
grave difficulties in the way of either of these explanations,
but we must not let our dread of the task
which remains to be done blind our eyes to the greatness
of Maxwell’s work.</p>

<p>One other important paper, and a number of
shorter articles, remain to be mentioned.</p>

<p>The Boltzmann-Maxwell law applies only to cases
in which the temperature is uniform throughout. In
a paper published in the Philosophical Transactions
for 1879, on “Stresses in Rarefied Gases Arising from
Inequalities of Temperature,” Maxwell deals, among
other matters, with the theory of the radiometer. He
shows that the observed motions will not take place
unless gas, in contact with a solid, can slide along<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
the surface of the solid with a finite velocity between
places where the temperature is different; and in an
appendix he proves that, on certain assumptions regarding
the nature of the contact of the solid and
the gas, there will be, even when the pressure is constant,
a flow of gas along the surface from the colder
to the hotter parts.</p>

<p>Among his less important papers bearing on
molecular theory must be mentioned a lecture on
“Molecules” to the British Association at its Bradford
meeting; “Scientific Papers of Clerk Maxwell,” vol. ii.,
p. 361; and another on “The Molecular Constitution
of Bodies,” Scientific Papers, vol. ii., p. 418.</p>

<p>In this latter, and also in a review in <i>Nature</i> of
Van der Waals’ book on “The Continuity of the
Gaseous and Liquid States,”<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> he explains and discusses
Clausius’ virial equation, by means of which
the variations of the permanent gases from Boyle’s
law are explained. The lecture gives a clear account,
in Maxwell’s own inimitable style, of the advances
made in the kinetic theory up to the date at which it
was delivered, and puts clearly the difficulties it has
to meet. Maxwell thought that those arising from
the known values of the ratio of the specific heats
were the most serious.</p>

<p>In the articles, “Atomic Constitution of Bodies”
and “Diffusion,” in the ninth edition of the <i>Encyclopædia
Britannica</i>, we have Maxwell’s later views on
the fundamental assumptions of the molecular theory.</p>

<p>The text-book on “Heat” contains some further
developments of the theory. In particular he shows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
how the conclusions of the second law of thermo-dynamics
are connected with the fact that the coarseness
of our faculties will not allow us to grapple with
individual molecules.</p>

<p>The work described in the foregoing chapters
would have been sufficient to secure to Maxwell a
distinguished place among those who have advanced
our knowledge; it remains still to describe his greatest
work, his theory of Electricity and Magnetism.</p>

<span class="subhead">SCIENTIFIC WORK.—ELECTRICAL THEORIES.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Clerk Maxwell’s</span> first electrical paper—that on
Faraday’s “Lines of Force”—was read to the Cambridge
Philosophical Society on December 10th, 1855,
and Part II. on February 11th, 1856. The author
was then a Bachelor of Arts, only twenty-three years
in age, and of less than one year’s standing from the
time of taking his degree.</p>

<p>The opening words of the paper are as follows
(Scientific Papers, vol. i., p. <span class="locked">155):—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The present state of electrical science seems peculiarly
unfavourable to speculation. The laws of the distribution of
electricity on the surface of conductors have been analytically
deduced from experiment; some parts of the mathematical
theory of magnetism are established, while in other parts the
experimental data are wanting; the theory of the conduction
of galvanism, and that of the mutual attraction of conductors,
have been reduced to mathematical formulæ, but have not
fallen into relation with the other parts of the science. No
electrical theory can now be put forth, unless it shows the
connection, not only between electricity at rest and current
electricity, but between the attractions and inductive effects of
electricity in both states. Such a theory must accurately
satisfy those laws, the mathematical form of which is known,
and must afford the means of calculating the effects in the
limiting cases where the known formulæ are inapplicable. In
order, therefore, to appreciate the requirements of the science,
the student must make himself familiar with a considerable
body of most intricate mathematics, the mere retention
of which in the memory materially interferes with further<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
progress. The first process, therefore, in the effectual study
of the science, must be one of simplification and reduction of
the results of previous investigation to a form in which the
mind can grasp them. The results of this simplification may
take the form of a purely mathematical formula or of a physical
hypothesis. In the first case we entirely lose sight of the
phenomena to be explained; and though we may trace out
the consequences of given laws, we can never obtain more
extended views of the connections of the subject. If, on the
other hand, we adopt a physical hypothesis, we see the
phenomena only through a medium, and are liable to that
blindness to facts and rashness in assumption which a partial
explanation encourages. We must therefore discover some
method of investigation which allows the mind at every step
to lay hold of a clear physical conception, without being committed
to any theory founded on the physical science from
which that conception is borrowed, so that it is neither drawn
aside from the subject in pursuit of analytical subtleties, nor
carried beyond the truth by a favourite hypothesis.</p>

<p>“In order to obtain physical ideas without adopting a
physical theory we must make ourselves familiar with the
existence of physical analogies. By a physical analogy I
mean that partial similarity between the laws of one science
and those of another which makes each of them illustrate the
other. Thus all the mathematical sciences are founded on
relations between physical laws and laws of numbers, so that
the aim of exact science is to reduce the problems of Nature to
the determination of quantities by operations with members.
Passing from the most universal of all analogies to a very
partial one, we find the same resemblance in mathematical
form between two different phenomena giving rise to a
physical theory of light.</p>

<p>“The changes of direction which light undergoes in passing
from one medium to another are identical with the deviations
of the path of a particle in moving through a narrow space in
which intense forces act. This analogy, which extends only to
the direction, and not to the velocity of motion, was long
believed to be the true explanation of the refraction of light;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
and we still find it useful in the solution of certain problems,
in which we employ it without danger as an artificial method.
The other analogy, between light and the vibrations of an
elastic medium, extends much farther, but, though its importance
and fruitfulness cannot be over-estimated, we must
recollect that it is founded only on a resemblance <em>in form</em>
between the laws of light and those of vibrations. By stripping
it of its physical dress and reducing it to a theory of ‘transverse
alternations,’ we might obtain a system of truth strictly founded
on observation, but probably deficient both in the vividness of
its conceptions and the fertility of its method. I have said
thus much on the disputed questions of optics, as a preparation
for the discussion of the almost universally admitted theory of
attraction at a distance.</p>

<p>“We have all acquired the mathematical conception of these
attractions. We can reason about them and determine their
appropriate forms or formulæ. These formulæ have a distinct
mathematical significance, and their results are found to be in
accordance with natural phenomena. There is no formula in
applied mathematics more consistent with Nature than the
formula of attractions, and no theory better established in the
minds of men than that of the action of bodies on one another
at a distance. The laws of the conduction of heat in uniform
media appear at first sight among the most different in their
physical relations from those relating to attractions. The
quantities which enter into them are <em>temperature</em>, <em>flow of heat</em>,
<em>conductivity</em>. The word <em>force</em> is foreign to the subject. Yet
we find that the mathematical laws of the uniform motion of
heat in homogeneous media are identical in form with those of
attractions varying inversely as the square of the distance. We
have only to substitute <em>source of heat</em> for <em>centre of attraction</em>,
<em>flow of heat</em> for <em>accelerating effect of attraction</em> at any point,
and <em>temperature</em> for <em>potential</em>, and the solution of a problem in
attractions is transformed into that of a problem in heat.</p>

<p>“This analogy between the formulæ of heat and attraction
was, I believe, first pointed out by Professor William Thomson
in the <cite>Cambridge Mathematical Journal</cite>, Vol. III.</p>

<p>“Now the conduction of heat is supposed to proceed by an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
action between contiguous parts of a medium, while the force
of attraction is a relation between distant bodies, and yet, if
we knew nothing more than is expressed in the mathematical
formulæ, there would be nothing to distinguish between the
one set of phenomena and the other.</p>

<p>“It is true that, if we introduce other considerations and
observe additional facts, the two subjects will assume very
different aspects, but the mathematical resemblance of some of
their laws will remain, and may still be made useful in exciting
appropriate mathematical ideas.</p>

<p>“It is by the use of analogies of this kind that I have attempted
to bring before the mind, in a convenient and manageable
form, those mathematical ideas which are necessary to the
study of the phenomena of electricity. The methods are generally
those suggested by the processes of reasoning which are
found in the researches of Faraday, and which, though they
have been interpreted mathematically by Professor Thomson
and others, are very generally supposed to be of an indefinite
and unmathematical character, when compared with those
employed by the professed mathematicians. By the method
which I adopt, I hope to render it evident that I am not
attempting to establish any physical theory of a science in
which I have hardly made a single experiment, and that the
limit of my design is to show how, by a strict application of
the ideas and methods of Faraday, the connection of the very
different orders of phenomena which he has discovered may be
clearly placed before the mathematical mind. I shall therefore
avoid as much as I can the introduction of anything which does
not serve as a direct illustration of Faraday’s methods, or of
the mathematical deductions which may be made from them.
In treating the simpler parts of the subject I shall use Faraday’s
mathematical methods as well as his ideas. When the complexity
of the subject requires it, I shall use analytical notation,
still confining myself to the development of ideas originated by
the same philosopher.</p>

<p>“I have in the first place to explain and illustrate the idea
of ‘lines of force.’</p>

<p>“When a body is electrified in any manner, a small body<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
charged with positive electricity, and placed in any given
position, will experience a force urging it in a certain direction.
If the small body be now negatively electrified, it will be urged
by an equal force in a direction exactly opposite.</p>

<p>“The same relations hold between a magnetic body and the
north or south poles of a small magnet. If the north pole is
urged in one direction, the south pole is urged in the opposite
direction.</p>

<p>“In this way we might find a line passing through any
point of space, such that it represents the direction of the force
acting on a positively electrified particle, or on an elementary
north pole, and the reverse direction of the force on a negatively
electrified particle or an elementary south pole. Since at every
point of space such a direction may be found, if we commence
at any point and draw a line so that, as we go along it, its
direction at any point shall always coincide with that of the
resultant force at that point, this curve will indicate the
direction of that force for every point through which it passes,
and might be called on that account a <em>line of force</em>. We might
in the same way draw other lines of force, till we had filled all
space with curves indicating by their direction that of the force
at any assigned point.</p>

<p>“We should thus obtain a geometrical model of the physical
phenomena, which would tell us the <em>direction</em> of the force, but
we should still require some method of indicating the <em>intensity</em>
of the force at any point. If we consider these curves not as
mere lines, but as fine tubes of variable section carrying an
incompressible fluid, then, since the velocity of the fluid is
inversely as the section of the tube, we may make the velocity
vary according to any given law, by regulating the section of
the tube, and in this way we might represent the intensity of
the force as well as its direction by the motion of the fluid in
these tubes. This method of representing the intensity of a
force by the velocity of an imaginary fluid in a tube is
applicable to any conceivable system of forces, but it is
capable of great simplification in the case in which the forces
are such as can be explained by the hypothesis of attractions
varying inversely as the square of the distance, such as those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
observed in electrical and magnetic phenomena. In the case
of a perfectly arbitrary system of forces, there will generally be
interstices between the tubes; but in the case of electric and
magnetic forces it is possible to arrange the tubes so as to
leave no interstices. The tubes will then be mere surfaces,
directing the motion of a fluid filling up the whole space. It
has been usual to commence the investigation of the laws of
these forces by at once assuming that the phenomena are due
to attractive or repulsive forces acting between certain points.
We may, however, obtain a different view of the subject, and
one more suited to our more difficult inquiries, by adopting for
the definition of the forces of which we treat, that they may be
represented in magnitude and direction by the uniform motion
of an incompressible fluid.</p>

<p>“I propose, then, first to describe a method by which the
motion of such a fluid can be clearly conceived; secondly to
trace the consequences of assuming certain conditions of
motion, and to point out the application of the method to
some of the less complicated phenomena of electricity,
magnetism, and galvanism; and lastly, to show how by an
extension of these methods, and the introduction of another
idea due to Faraday, the laws of the attractions and inductive
actions of magnets and currents may be clearly conceived,
without making any assumptions as to the physical nature of
electricity, or adding anything to that which has been already
proved by experiment.</p>

<p>“By referring everything to the purely geometrical idea of
the motion of an imaginary fluid, I hope to attain generality
and precision, and to avoid the dangers arising from a premature
theory professing to explain the cause of the
phenomena. If the results of mere speculation which I have
collected are found to be of any use to experimental philosophers,
in arranging and interpreting their results, they will
have served their purpose, and a mature theory, in which
physical facts will be physically explained, will be formed by
those who by interrogating Nature herself can obtain the only
true solution of the questions which the mathematical theory
suggests.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span></p>

<p>The idea was a bold one: for a youth of twenty-three
to explain, by means of the motions of an
incompressible fluid, some of the less complicated
phenomena of electricity and magnetism, to show how
the laws of the attractions of magnets and currents
may be clearly conceived without making any assumption
as to the physical nature of electricity, or
adding anything to that which has already been
proved by experiment.</p>

<p>It may be useful to review in a very few words
the position of electrical theory<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> in 1855.</p>

<p>Coulomb’s experiments had established the fundamental
facts of electrostatic attraction and repulsion,
and Coulomb himself, about 1785, had stated a theory
based on these experiments which could “only be
attacked by proving his experimental results to be
inaccurate.”<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a></p>

<p>Coulomb supposes the existence of two electric
fluids, the theory developed previously by Franklin,
but <span class="locked">says—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Je préviens pour mettre la théorie qui va suivre à l’abri
de toute dispute systématique, que dans la supposition de
deux fluides électriques, je n’ai autre intention que de présenter
avec le moins d’éléments possible les résultats du calcul et
de l’expérience, et non d’indiquer les véritables causes de
l’électricité.”</p>
</div>

<p>Cavendish was working in England about the
same time as Coulomb, but he published very little,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
and the value and importance of his work was not
recognised until the appearance in 1879 of the
“Electrical Researches of Henry Cavendish,” edited
by Clerk Maxwell.</p>

<p>Early in the present century the application of
mathematical analysis to electrical problems was
begun by Laplace, who investigated the distribution
of electricity on spheroids, and about 1811 Poisson’s
great work on the distribution of electricity on two
spheres placed at any given distance apart was published.
Meanwhile the properties of the electric
current were being investigated. Galvani’s discovery
of the muscular contraction in a frog’s leg, caused by
the contact of dissimilar metals, was made in 1790.
Volta invented the voltaic pile in 1800, and Oersted in
1820 discovered that an electric current produced
magnetic force in its neighbourhood. On this Ampère
laid the foundation of his theory of electro-dynamics,
in which he showed how to calculate the forces between
circuits carrying currents from an assumed law
of force between each pair of elements of the circuits.
His experiments proved that the consequences which
follow from this law are consistent with all the
observed facts. They do not prove that Ampère’s law
alone can explain the facts.</p>

<p>Maxwell, writing on this subject in the “Electricity
an Magnetism,” vol. ii., p. 162, <span class="locked">says—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The experimental investigation by which Ampère established
the laws of the mechanical action between electric
currents is one of the most brilliant achievements in science.</p>

<p>“The whole, theory and experiment, seems as if it had
leaped full grown and full armed from the brain of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
‘Newton of Electricity.’ It is perfect in form and unassailable
in accuracy, and it is summed up in a formula from
which all the phenomena may be deduced, and which must
always remain the cardinal formula of electro-dynamics.</p>

<p>“The method of Ampère, however, though cast into an
inductive form, does not allow us to trace the formation of the
ideas which guided it. We can scarcely believe that Ampère
really discovered the law of action by means of the experiments
which he describes. We are led to suspect, what, indeed,
he tells us himself, that he discovered the law by some process
which he has not shown us, and that when he had afterwards
built up a perfect demonstration, he removed all traces of the
scaffolding by which he had built it.”</p>
</div>

<p>The experimental evidence for Ampère’s theory,
so far, at least, as it was possible to obtain it from
experiments on closed circuits, was rendered unimpeachable
by W. Weber about 1846, while in the
previous year Grassman and F. E. Neumann both
published laws for the attraction between two elements
of current which differ from that of Ampère, but lead
to the same result for closed circuits. In a paper
published in 1846 Weber announced his hypothesis
connecting together electrostatic and electro-dynamic
action. In this paper he supposed that the force
between two particles of electricity depends on the
motion of the particles as well as on their distance
apart. A somewhat similar theory was proposed by
Gauss and published after his death in his collected
works. It has been shown, however, that Gauss’
theory is inconsistent with the conservation of energy.
Weber’s theory avoids this inconsistency and leads, for
closed circuits, to the same results as Ampère. It has
been proved, however, by Von Helmholtz, that, under
certain circumstances, according to it, a body would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
behave as though its mass were negative—it would
move in a direction opposite to that of the force.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a></p>

<p>Since 1846 many other theories have been proposed
to explain Ampère’s laws. Meanwhile, in 1821,
Faraday observed that under certain circumstances a
wire carrying a current could be kept in continuous
rotation in a magnetic field by the action between the
magnets and the current. In 1824 Arago observed
the motion of a magnet caused by rotating a copper
disc in its neighbourhood, while in 1831 Faraday
began his experimental researches into electro-magnetic
induction. About the same period Joseph Henry, of
Washington, was making, independently of Faraday,
experiments of fundamental importance on electro-magnetic
induction, but sufficient attention was not
called to his work until comparatively recent years.</p>

<p>In 1833 Lenz made some important researches,
which led him to discover the connection between the
direction of the induced currents and Ampère’s laws,
summed up in his rule that the direction of the
induced current is always such as to oppose by its
electro-magnetic action the motion which induces it.</p>

<p>In 1845 F. E. Neumann developed from this law
the mathematical theory of electro-magnetic induction,
and about the same time W. Weber showed how it
might be deduced from his elementary law of
electrical action.</p>

<p>The great name of Von Helmholtz first appears in
connection with this subject in 1851, but of his
writings we shall have more to say at a later stage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span></p>

<p>Meanwhile, during the same period, various
writers, Murphy, Plana, Charles, Sturm, and Gauss,
extended Poisson’s work on electrostatics, treating the
questions which arose as problems in the distribution
of an attracting fluid, attracting or repelling according
to Newton’s law, though here again the greatest
advances were made by a self-taught Nottingham
shoemaker, George Green by name, in his paper “On
the Application of Mathematical Analysis to the
Theories of Electricity and Magnetism,” 1828.</p>

<p>Green’s researches, Lord Kelvin writes, “have led to
the elementary proposition which must constitute the
legitimate foundation of every perfect mathematical
structure that is to be made from the materials furnished
by the experimental laws of Coulomb.”</p>

<p>Green, it may be remarked, was the inventor of
the term Potential. His essay, however, lay neglected
from 1828, until Lord Kelvin called attention to it in
1845. Meanwhile, some of its most important results
had been re-discovered by Gauss and Charles and
Thomson himself.</p>

<p>Until about 1845, the experimental work on which
these mathematical researches in electrostatics were
based was that of Coulomb. An electrified body is
supposed to have a charge of some imponderable fluid
“electricity.” Particles of electricity repel each other
according to a certain law, and the fluid distributes
itself in equilibrium over the surface of any charged
conductor in accordance with this law. There are on
this theory two opposite kinds of electric fluid, positive
and negative, two charges of the same kind repel, two
charges of opposite kinds attract; the repulsion or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
attraction is proportional to the product of the charges,
and inversely proportional to the square of the
distance between them.</p>

<p>The action between two charges is action at a
distance taking place across the space which separates
the two.</p>

<p>Faraday, in 1837, in the eleventh series of his
“Experimental Researches,” published his first paper
on “Electrostatic Induction.” He showed—as indeed
Cavendish had proved long previously, though the
result remained unpublished—that the force between
two charged bodies will depend on the insulating
medium which surrounds them, not merely on their
shape and position. Induction, as he expresses it,
takes place along curved lines, and is an action of
contiguous particles; these curved lines he calls the
“lines of force.”</p>

<p>Discussing these researches in 1845, Lord Kelvin
<span class="locked">writes<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a>:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Mr. Faraday’s researches ... were undertaken with a
view to test an idea which he had long possessed that the
forces of attraction and repulsion exercised by free electricity
are not the resultants of actions exercised at a distance, but are
propagated by means of molecular action among the contiguous
particles of the insulating medium surrounding the
electrified bodies, which he therefore calls the dielectric. By
this idea he has been led to some very remarkable views upon
induction, or, in fact, upon electrical action in general. As it
is impossible that the phenomena observed by Faraday can be
incompatible with the results of experiment which constitute
Coulomb’s theory, it is to be expected that the difference of
his ideas from those of Coulomb must arise solely from a
different method of stating and interpreting physically the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
same laws; and further, it may, I think, be shown that either
method of viewing this subject, when carried sufficiently far,
may be made the foundation of a mathematical theory which
would lead to the elementary principles of the other as consequences.
This theory would, accordingly, be the expression of
the ultimate law of the phenomena, independently of any
physical hypothesis we might from other circumstances be led
to adopt. That there are necessarily two distinct elementary
ways of viewing the theory of electricity may be seen from the
following considerations....”</p>
</div>

<p>In the pages which follow, Lord Kelvin develops
the consequences of an analogy between the conduction
of heat and electrostatic action, which he had
pointed out three years earlier (1842), in his paper on
“The Uniform Motion of Heat in Homogeneous Solid
Bodies,” and discusses its connection with the mathematical
theory of electricity.</p>

<p>The problem of distributing sources of heat in a
given homogeneous conductor of heat, so as to produce
a definite steady temperature at each point on
the conductor is shewn to be <em>mathematically</em> identical
with that of distributing electricity in equilibrium, so
as to produce at each point an electrical potential
having the same value as the temperature.</p>

<p>Thus the fundamental laws of the conduction of
heat may be made the basis of the mathematical
theory of electricity, but the physical idea which
they suggest is that of the propagation of some effect
by means of the mutual action of contiguous particles,
rather than that of material particles attracting or
repelling at a distance, which naturally follows from
the statement of Coulomb’s law.</p>

<p>Lord Kelvin <span class="locked">continues:—</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“All the views which Faraday has brought forward and
illustrated, as demonstrated by experiment, lead to this method
of establishing the mathematical theory, and, as far as the
analysis is concerned, it would in most <em>general</em> propositions be
more simple, if possible, than that of Coulomb. Of course the
analysis of <em>particular</em> problems would be identical in the two
methods. It is thus that Faraday arrives at a knowledge of
some of the most important of the mathematical theorems
which from their nature seemed destined never to be perceived
except as mathematical truths.”</p>
</div>

<p>Lord Kelvin’s papers on “The Mathematical
Theory of Electricity,” published from 1848 to 1850,
his “Propositions on the Theory of Attraction”
(1842), his “Theory of Electrical Images” (1847),
and his paper on “The Mathematical Theory of
Magnetism” (1849), contain a statement of the most
important results achieved in the mathematical
sciences of Electrostatics and Magnetism up to the
time of Maxwell’s first paper.</p>

<p>The opening sentences of that paper have already
been quoted. In the preface to the “Electricity and
Magnetism” Maxwell writes <span class="locked">thus:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Before I began the study of electricity I resolved to read
no mathematics on the subject till I had first read through
‘Experimental Researches on Electricity.’ I was aware that
there was supposed to be a difference between Faraday’s way
of conceiving phenomena and that of the mathematicians, so
that neither he nor they were satisfied with each other’s
language. I had also the conviction that this discrepancy did
not arise from either party being wrong. I was first convinced
of this by Sir William Thomson, to whose advice and assistance,
as well as to his published papers, I owe most of what I
have learned on the subject.</p>

<p>“As I proceeded with the study of Faraday, I perceived
that his method of conceiving the phenomena was also a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
mathematical one, though not exhibited in the conventional
form of mathematical symbols. I also found that these
methods were capable of being expressed in the ordinary
mathematical forms, and thus compared with those of the professed
mathematicians.</p>

<p>“For instance, Faraday, in his mind’s eye, saw lines of
force traversing all space where the mathematicians saw
centres of force attracting at a distance. Faraday saw a
medium where they saw nothing but distance. Faraday
sought the seat of the phenomena in real actions going on in
the medium. They were satisfied that they had found it
in a power of action at a distance impressed on the electric
fluids.”</p>
</div>

<p>Now, Maxwell saw an analogy between electrostatics
and the steady motion of an incompressible
fluid like water, and it is this analogy which he develops
in the first part of his paper. The water flows along
definite lines; a surface which consists wholly of such
lines of flow will have the property that no water ever
crosses it. In any stream of water we can imagine a
number of such surfaces drawn, dividing it up into a
series of tubes; each of these will be a tube of flow, each
of these tubes remain always filled with water. Hence,
the quantity of water which crosses per second any
section of a tube of flow perpendicular to its length is
always the same. Thus, from the form of the tube,
we can obtain information as to the direction and
strength of the flow, for where the tube is wide the
flow will be proportionately small, and <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">vice versâ</i>.</p>

<p>Again, we can draw in the fluid a number of surfaces,
over each of which the pressure is the same;
these surfaces will cut the tubes of flow at right
angles. Let us suppose they are drawn so that the
difference of pressure between any two consecutive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
surfaces is unity, then the surfaces will be close
together at points at which the pressure changes
rapidly; where the variation of pressure is slow, the
distance between two consecutive surfaces will be
considerable.</p>

<p>If, then, in any case of motion, we can draw the
pressure surfaces, and the tubes of flow, we can determine
the motion of the fluid completely. Now,
the same mathematical expressions which appear in
the hydro-dynamical theory occur also in the theory
of electricity, the meaning only of the symbols is
changed. For velocity of fluid we have to write
electrical force. For difference of fluid pressure we
substitute work done, or difference of electrical
potential or pressure.</p>

<p>The surfaces and tubes, drawn as the solution
of any hydro-dynamical problem, give us also the
solution of an electrical problem; the tubes of flow are
Faraday’s tubes of force, or tubes of induction, the
surfaces of constant pressure are surfaces of equal
electrical potential. Induction may take place in
curved lines just as the tubes of flow may be bent and
curved; the analogy between the two is a complete
one.</p>

<p>But, as Maxwell shows, the analogy reaches further
still. An electric current flowing along a wire had
been recognised as having many properties similar to
those of a current of liquid in a tube. When a steady
current is passing through any solid conductor, there
are formed in the conductor tubes of electrical flow
and surfaces of constant pressure. These tubes and
surfaces are the same as those formed by the flow of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
liquid through a solid whose boundary surface is the
same as that of the conductor, provided the flow of
liquid is properly proportioned to the flow of electricity.</p>

<p>These analogies refer to steady currents in which,
therefore, the flow at any point of the conductor does
not depend on the time. In Part II. of his paper Maxwell
deals with Faraday’s electro-tonic state. Faraday
had found that when <em>changes</em> are produced in the magnetic
phenomena surrounding a conductor, an electric
current is set up in the conductor, which continues so
long as the magnetic changes are in progress, but
which ceases when the magnetic state becomes steady.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Considerations of this kind led Professor Faraday to
connect with his discovery of the induction of electric currents
the conception of a state into which all bodies are thrown by
the presence of magnets and currents. This state does not
manifest itself by any known phenomena as long as it is undisturbed,
but any change in this state is indicated by a
current or tendency towards a current. To this state he gave
the name of the ‘Electro-tonic State,’ and although he afterwards
succeeded in explaining the phenomena which suggested
it by means of less hypothetical conceptions, he has on several
occasions hinted at the probability that some phenomena
might be discovered which would render the electro-tonic
state an object of legitimate induction. These speculations,
into which Faraday had been led by the study of laws which
he has well established, and which he abandoned only for
want of experimental data for the direct proof of the unknown
state, have not, I think, been made the subject of mathematical
investigation. Perhaps it may be thought that the quantitative
determinations of the various phenomena are not sufficiently
rigorous to be made the basis of a mathematical theory.
Faraday, however, has not contented himself with simply
stating the numerical results of his experiments and leaving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
the law to be discovered by calculation. Where he has perceived
a law he has at once stated it, in terms as unambiguous
as those of pure mathematics, and if the mathematician, receiving
this as a physical truth, deduces from it other laws
capable of being tested by experiment, he has merely assisted
the physicist in arranging his own ideas, which is confessedly
a necessary step in scientific induction.</p>

<p>“In the following investigation, therefore, the laws established
by Faraday will be assumed as true, and it will be
shown that by following out his speculations other and more
general laws can be deduced from them. If it should, then,
appear that these laws, originally devised to include one set of
phenomena, may be generalised so as to extend to phenomena
of a different class, these mathematical connections may
suggest to physicists the means of establishing physical connections,
and thus mere speculation may be turned to account
in experimental science.”</p>
</div>

<p>Maxwell shows how to obtain a mathematical expression
for Faraday’s electro-tonic state. In his
“Electricity and Magnetism,” this electro-tonic state
receives a new name. It is known as the Vector
Potential,<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> and the paper under consideration contains,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
though in an incomplete form, his first statement of
those equations of the electric field which are so indissolubly
bound up with Maxwell’s name.</p>

<p>The great advance in theory made in the paper is
the distinct recognition of certain mathematical
functions as representing Faraday’s electrotonic-state,
and their use in solving electro-magnetic problems.</p>

<p>The paper contains no new physical theory of
electricity, but in a few years one appeared. In his
later writings Maxwell adopted a more general view
of the electro-magnetic field than that contained
in his early papers on “Physical Lines of Force.” It
must, therefore, not be supposed that the somewhat
gross conception of cog-wheels and pulleys, which we
are about to describe, were anything more to their
author than a model, which enabled him to realise
how the changes, which occur when a current of
electricity passes through a wire, might be represented
by the motion of actual material particles.</p>

<p>The problem before him was to devise a physical
theory of electricity, which would explain the forces
exerted on electrified bodies by means of action
between the contiguous parts of the medium in the
space surrounding these bodies, rather than by direct
action across the distance which separates them. A
similar question, still unanswered, had arisen in the
case of gravitation. Astronomers have determined
the forces between attracting bodies; they do not
know how those forces arise.</p>

<p>Maxwell’s fondness for models has already been
alluded to; it had led him to construct his top to
illustrate the dynamics of a rigid body rotating about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
a fixed point, and his model of Saturn’s rings (now in
the Cavendish Laboratory) to illustrate the motion of
the satellites in the rings. He had explained many of
the gaseous laws by means of the impact of molecules,
and now his fertile ingenuity was to imagine a
mechanical model of the state of the electro-magnetic
field near a system of conductors carrying currents.</p>

<p>Faraday, as we have seen, looked upon electrostatic
and magnetic induction as taking place along
curved lines of force. He pictures these lines as
ropes of molecules starting from a charged conductor,
or a magnet, as the case may be, and acting on other
bodies near. These ropes of molecules tend to
shorten, and at the same time to swell outwards
laterally. Thus the charged conductor tends to draw
other bodies to itself, there is a tension along the
lines of force, while at the same time each tube of
molecules pushes its neighbours aside; a pressure at
right angles to the lines of force is combined with
this tension. Assuming for a moment this pressure
and tension to exist, can we devise a mechanism to
account for it? Maxwell himself has likened the
lines of force to the fibres of a muscle. As the fibres
contract, causing the limb to which they are attached
to move, they swell outwards, and the muscle thickens.</p>

<p>Again, from another point of view, we might consider
a line of force as consisting of a string of small
cells of some flexible material each filled with fluid.
If we then suppose this series of cells caused to
rotate rapidly about the direction of the line of force,
the cells will expand laterally and contract longitudinally;
there will again be tension along the lines<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
of force and pressure at right angles to them. It was
this last idea, as we shall see shortly, of which Maxwell
made <span class="locked">use—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I propose now” [he writes (“On Physical Lines of Force,”
<cite>Phil. Mag.</cite>, vol. xxi.)] “to examine magnetic phenomena from
a mechanical point of view, and to determine what tensions
in, or motions of, a medium are capable of producing the
mechanical phenomena observed. If by the same hypothesis
we can connect the phenomena of magnetic attraction with
electro-magnetic phenomena, and with those of induced currents,
we shall have found a theory which, if not true, can
only be proved to be erroneous by experiments, which will
greatly enlarge our knowledge of this part of physics.”</p>
</div>

<p>Lord Kelvin had in 1847 given a mechanical
representation of electric, magnetic and galvanic forces
by means of the displacements of an elastic solid in a
state of strain. The angular displacement at each
point of the solid was taken as proportional to the
magnetic force, and from this the relation between
the various other electric quantities and the motion
of the solid was developed. But Lord Kelvin did not
attempt to explain the origin of the observed forces
by the effects due to these strains, but merely made
use of the mathematical analogy to assist the imagination
in the study of both.</p>

<p>Maxwell considered magnetic action as existing
in the form of pressure or tension, or more generally,
of some stress in some medium. The existence
of a medium capable of exerting force on material
bodies and of withstanding considerable stress, both
pressure and tension, is thus a fundamental hypothesis
with him; this medium is to be capable of motion,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
and electro-magnetic forces arise from its motion and
its stresses.</p>

<p>Now, Maxwell’s fundamental supposition is that,
in a magnetic field, there is a rotation of the molecules
continually in progress about the lines of magnetic
force. Consider now the case of a uniform
magnetic field, whose direction is perpendicular to
the paper; we are to look upon the lines of force
as parallel strings of molecules, the axes of these
strings being perpendicular to the paper. Each
string is supposed to be rotating in the same direction
about its axis, and the angular velocity of rotation
is a measure of the magnetic force. In consequence
of this rotation there will be differences of
pressure in different directions in the medium; the
pressure along the axes of the strings will be less than
it would be if the medium were at rest, that in the
directions at right angles to the axes will be greater,
the medium will behave as though it were under
tension along the axes of the molecules under
pressure at right angles to them. Moreover, it can
be shown that the pressure and the tension are both
proportional to the square of the angular velocity—the
square, that is, of the magnetic force—and
this result is in accordance with the consequences
of experiment.</p>

<p>More elaborate calculation shows that this statement
is true generally. If we draw the lines of force
in any magnetic field, and then suppose the molecules
of the medium set in rotation about these lines of
force as axes, with velocities which at each point are
proportional to the magnetic force, the distribution of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
pressure throughout is that which we know actually
to exist in the magnetic field.</p>

<p>According to this hypothesis, then, a permanent
bar magnet has the power of setting the medium
round it into continuous molecular rotation about the
lines of force as axes. The molecules which are set
in rotation we may consider as spherical, or nearly
spherical, cells filled with a fluid, or an elastic solid
substance, and surrounded by a kind of membrane, or
sack, holding the contents together.</p>

<p>So far the model does not give any account of
electrical actions which go on in the magnetic field.</p>

<p>The energy is wholly rotational, and the forces
wholly magnetic.</p>

<p>Consider, however, any two contiguous strings of
molecules. Let them cut the paper as shown in the
two circles in <span class="locked"><a href="#ip_170">Fig. 1</a>:—</span></p>

<div id="ip_170" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 28em;">
  <img src="images/i_170.png" width="1343" height="284" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p> <span class="floatl in4">Fig. 1.</span>
  <span class="floatr l4">Fig. 2.</span></p></div></div>

<p>Then these cells are both rotating in the same
direction, hence at C, where they touch, their points of
contact will be moving in opposite directions, as shown
by the arrow heads, and it is difficult to imagine how
such motion can continue; it would require the surfaces
of the cells to be perfectly smooth, and if this
were so they would lose the power of transmitting
action from one cell to the next.</p>

<p>The cells A and B may be compared to two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
cog-wheels placed close together, which we wish to turn
in the same direction. If the cogs can interlock, as in
<a href="#ip_170">Fig. 2</a>, this is impossible: consecutive wheels in the
train must move in opposite directions.</p>

<div id="ip_171" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 15em;">
  <img src="images/i_171.png" width="707" height="283" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Fig. 3.</div></div>

<p>But in many machines the desired end is attained
by inserting between the two wheels A and B a third
idle wheel C, as shewn in <a href="#ip_171">Fig. 3</a>. This may be very
small, its only function is to transmit the motion of A
to B in such a way that A and B may both turn in the
same direction. It is not necessary that there should
be cogs on the wheels; if the surfaces be perfectly
rough, so that no slipping can take place, the same
result follows without the cogs.</p>

<p>Guided by this analogy Maxwell extended his
model by supposing each cell coated with a number
of small particles which roll on its surface. These
particles play the part of the idle wheels in the
machine, and by their rolling merely enable the
adjacent parts of two cells to move in opposite
directions.</p>

<p>Consider now a number of such cells and their idle
wheels lying in a plane, that of the paper, and suppose
each cell is rotating with the same uniform angular
velocity about an axis at right angles to that plane,
each idle wheel will be acted on by two equal and
opposite forces at the ends of the diameter in which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
it is touched by the adjacent cells; it will therefore
be set in rotation, but there will be no force tending
to drive it onwards; it does not matter whether the
axis on which it rotates is free to move or fixed, in
either case the idle wheel simply rotates. But suppose
now the adjacent cells are not rotating at the same
rate. In addition to its rotation the idle wheel will be
urged onward with a velocity which depends on the
difference between the rotations, and, if it can move
freely, it will move on from between the two cells.
Imagine now that the interstices between the cells
are fitted with a string of idle wheels. So long as the
adjacent cells move with different velocity there will
be a continual stream of rolling particles or idle wheels
between them. Maxwell in the paper considered
these rolling particles to be particles of electricity.
Their motion constitutes an electric current. In a
uniform magnetic field there is no electric current;
if the strength of the field varies, the idle wheels are
set in motion and there may be a current.</p>

<p>These particles are very small compared with the
magnetic vortices. The mass of all the particles is inappreciable
compared with the mass of the vortices,
and a great many vortices with their surrounding
particles are contained in a molecule of the medium;
the particles roll on the vortices without touching
each other, so that so long as they remain within the
same molecule there is no loss of energy by resistance.
When, however, there is a current or general transference
of particles in one direction they must pass
from one molecule to another, and in doing so may
experience resistance and generate heat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span></p>

<p>Maxwell states that the conception of a particle,
having its motion connected with that of a vortex by
perfect rolling contact, may appear somewhat awkward.
“I do not bring it forward,” he writes, “as a mode of
connection existing in Nature, or even as that which
I would willingly assent to as an electrical hypothesis.
It is, however, a mode of connection which is mechanically
conceivable and easily investigated, and it serves
to bring out the actual mechanical connections
between the known electro-magnetic phenomena, so
that I venture to say that anyone who understands
the provisional and temporary character of this
hypothesis will find himself rather helped than
hindered by it in his search after the true interpretation
of the phenomena.”</p>

<p>The first part of the paper deals with the theory
of magnetism; in the second part the hypothesis is
applied to the phenomena of electric currents, and it
is shown how the known laws of steady currents and
of electro-magnetic induction can be deduced from it.
In Part III., published January and February, 1862, the
theory of molecular vortices is applied to statical
electricity.</p>

<p>The distinction between a conductor and an
insulator or dielectric is supposed to be that in the
former the particles of electricity can pass with more
or less freedom from molecule to molecule. In the
latter such transference is impossible, the particles can
only be displaced within the molecule with which
they are connected; the cells or vortices of the
medium are supposed to be elastic, and to resist by
their elasticity the displacement of the particles within<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
them. When electrical force acts on the medium this
displacement of the particles within each molecule
takes place until the stresses due to the elastic reaction
of the vortices balance the electrical force; the
medium behaves like an elastic body yielding to
pressure until the pressure is balanced by the elastic
stress. When the electric force is removed the cells
or vortices recover their form, the electricity returns
to its former position.</p>

<p>In a medium such as this waves of periodic
displacement could be set up, and would travel with
a velocity depending on its electric properties. The
value for this velocity can be obtained from electrical
observations, and Maxwell showed that this velocity,
so found, was, within the limits of experimental error,
the same as that of light. Moreover, the electrical
oscillations take place, like those of light, in the front
of the wave. Hence, he concludes, “the elasticity of
the magnetic medium in air is the same as that of
the luminiferous medium, if these two coexistent,
coextensive, and equally elastic media are not rather
one medium.”</p>

<p>The paper thus contains the first germs of the
electro-magnetic theory of light. Moreover, it is
shown that the attraction between two small bodies
charged with given quantities of electricity depends
on the medium in which they are placed, while the
specific inductive capacity is found to be proportional
to the square of the refractive index.</p>

<p>The fourth and final part of the paper investigates
the propagation of light in a magnetic field.</p>

<p>Faraday had shown that the direction of vibration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
in a wave of polarised light travelling parallel to the
lines of force in a magnetic field is rotated by its
passage through the field. The numerical laws of
this relation had been investigated by Verdet, and
Maxwell showed how his hypothesis of molecular
vortices led to laws which agree in the main with
those found by Verdet.</p>

<p>He points out that the connection between
magnetism and electricity has the same mathematical
form as that between certain other pairs of
phenomena, one of which has a <em>linear</em> and the other
a <em>rotatory</em> character; and, further, that an analogy
may be worked out assuming either the linear
character for magnetism and the rotatory character
for electricity, or the reverse. He alludes to Prof.
Challis’ theory, according to which magnetism is to
consist in currents in a fluid whose directions correspond
with the lines of magnetic force, while electric
currents are supposed to be accompanied by, if not
dependent upon, a rotatory motion of the fluid about
the axis of the current; and to Von Helmholtz’s
theory of a somewhat similar character. He then
gives his own reasons—agreeing with those of Sir
W. Thomson (Lord Kelvin)—for supposing that there
must be a real rotation going on in a magnetic field
in order to account for the rotation of the plane of
polarisation, and, accepting these reasons as valid, he
develops the consequences of his theory with the
results stated above.</p>

<p>His own verdict on the theory is given in the
“Electricity and Magnetism” (vol. ii., § 831, first
edition, <span class="locked">p. 416):—</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A theory of molecular vortices, which I worked out at considerable
length, was published in the <i>Phil. Mag.</i> for March,
April, and May, 1861; Jan. and Feb., 1862.</p>

<p>“I think we have good evidence for the opinion that some
phenomenon of rotation is going on in the magnetic field, that
this rotation is performed by a great number of very small
portions of matter, each rotating on its own axis, this axis
being parallel to the direction of the magnetic force, and that
the rotations of these different vortices are made to depend on one
another by means of some kind of mechanism connecting them.</p>

<p>“The attempt which I then made to imagine a working
model of this mechanism must be taken for no more than it
really is, a demonstration that mechanism may be imagined
capable of producing a connection mechanically equivalent to
the actual connection of the parts of the electro-magnetic field.
The problem of determining the mechanism required to
establish a given species of connection between the motions of
the parts of a system always admits of an infinite number of
solutions. Of these, some may be more clumsy or more complex
than others, but all must satisfy the conditions of
mechanism in general.</p>

<p>“The following results of the theory, however, are of
higher <span class="locked">value:—</span></p>

<p>“(1) Magnetic force is the effect of the centrifugal force of
the vortices.</p>

<p>“(2) Electro-magnetic induction of currents is the effect of
the forces called into play when the velocity of the vortices is
changing.</p>

<p>“(3) Electromotive force arises from the stress on the connecting
mechanism.</p>

<p>“(4) Electric displacement arises from the elastic yielding
of the connecting mechanism.”</p>
</div>

<p>In studying this part of Maxwell’s work, it must
clearly be remembered that he did not look upon the
ether as a series of cog-wheels with idle wheels between,
or anything of the kind. He devised a mechanical
model of such cogs and idle wheels, the properties<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
of which would in some respects closely resemble
those of the ether; from this model he deduced,
among other things, the important fact that electric
waves would travel outwards with the velocity of
light. Other such models have been devised since
his time to illustrate the same laws. Prof. Fitzgerald
has actually constructed one of wheels connected
together by elastic bands, which shows clearly the kind
of processes which Maxwell supposed to go on in a
dielectric when under electric force. Professor Lodge,
in his book, “Modern Views of Electricity,” has very
fully developed a somewhat different arrangement of
cog-wheels to attain the same result.</p>

<p>Maxwell’s predictions as to the propagation of
electric waves have in recent days received their full
verification in the brilliant experiments of Hertz and
his followers; it remains for us, before dealing with
these, to trace their final development in his hands.</p>

<p>The papers we have been discussing were perhaps
too material to receive the full attention they
deserved; the ether is not a series of cogs, and electricity
is something different from material idle
wheels. In his paper on “The Dynamical Theory of the
Electro-magnetic Field,” <i>Phil. Trans.</i>, 1864, Maxwell
treats the same questions in a more general manner.
On a former occasion he says, “I have attempted to
describe a particular kind of motion and a particular
kind of strain so arranged as to account for the
phenomena. In the present paper I avoid any
hypothesis of this kind; and in using such words as
electric momentum and electric elasticity in reference
to the known phenomena of the induction of currents<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
and the polarisation of dielectrics, I wish merely to
direct the mind of the reader to mechanical phenomena,
which will assist him in understanding the
electrical ones. All such phrases in the present
paper are to be considered as illustrative and not as
explanatory.” He then <span class="locked">continues:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In speaking of the energy of the field, however, I wish to
be understood literally. All energy is the same as mechanical
energy, whether it exists in the form of motion or in that of
elasticity, or in any other form.</p>

<p>“The energy in electro-magnetic phenomena is mechanical
energy. The only question is, Where does it reside?</p>

<p>“On the old theories it resides in the electrified bodies, conducting
circuits, and magnets, in the form of an unknown
quality called potential energy, or the power of producing
certain effects at a distance. On our theory it resides in the
electro-magnetic field, in the space surrounding the electrified
and magnetic bodies, as well as in those bodies themselves,
and is in two different forms, which may be described without
hypothesis as magnetic polarisation and electric polarisation,
or, according to a very probable hypothesis, as the motion and
the strain of one and the same medium.</p>

<p>“The conclusions arrived at in the present paper are independent
of this hypothesis, being deduced from experimental
facts of three <span class="locked">kinds:—</span></p>

<p>“(1) The induction of electric currents by the increase or
diminution of neighbouring currents according to the changes
in the lines of force passing through the circuit.</p>

<p>“(2) The distribution of magnetic intensity according to
the variations of a magnetic potential.</p>

<p>“(3) The induction (or influence) of statical electricity
through dielectrics.</p>

<p>“We may now proceed to demonstrate from these principles
the existence and laws of the mechanical forces, which act
upon electric currents, magnets, and electrified bodies placed
in the electro-magnetic field.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span></p>

<p>In his introduction to the paper, he discusses in a
general way the various explanations of electric phenomena
which had been given, and points out <span class="locked">that—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It appears, therefore, that certain phenomena in electricity
and magnetism lead to the same conclusion as those of optics,
namely, that there is an ætherial medium pervading all bodies,
and modified only in degree by their presence; that the parts
of this medium are capable of being set in motion by electric
currents and magnets; that this motion is communicated from
one part of the medium to another by forces arising from the
connection of those parts; that under the action of these
forces there is a certain yielding depending on the elasticity of
these connections; and that, therefore, energy in two different
forms may exist in the medium, the one form being the actual
energy of motion of its parts, and the other being the potential
energy stored up in the connections in virtue of their elasticity.</p>

<p>“Thus, then, we are led to the conception of a complicated
mechanism capable of a vast variety of motion, but at the
same time so connected that the motion of one part depends,
according to definite relations, on the motion of other parts,
these motions being communicated by forces arising from the
relative displacement of the connected parts, in virtue of their
elasticity. Such a mechanism must be subject to the general
laws of dynamics, and we ought to be able to work out all the
consequences of its motion, provided we know the form of the
relation between the motions of the parts.”</p>
</div>

<p>These general laws of dynamics, applicable to the
motion of any connected system, had been developed
by Lagrange, and are expressed in his generalised
equations of motion. It is one of Maxwell’s chief
claims to fame that he saw in the electric field a
connected system to which Lagrange’s equations could
be applied, and that he was able to deduce the
mechanical and electrical actions which take place by
means of fundamental propositions of dynamics.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span></p>

<p>The methods of the paper now under discussion
were developed further in the “Treatise on Electricity
and Magnetism,” published in 1873; in endeavouring
to give some slight account of Maxwell’s work, we
shall describe it in the form it ultimately took.</p>

<p>The task which Maxwell set himself was a double
one; he had first to express in symbols, in as general
a form as possible, the fundamental laws of electro-magnetism
as deduced from experiments, chiefly the
experiments of Faraday, and the relations between
the various quantities involved; when this was done
he had to show how these laws could be deduced from
the general dynamical laws applicable to any system
of moving bodies.</p>

<p>There are two classes of phenomena, electric and
magnetic, which have been known from very early
times, and which are connected together. When a
piece of sealing-wax is rubbed it is found to attract
other bodies, it is said to exert electric force throughout
the space surrounding it; when two different
metals are dipped in slightly acidulated water and
connected by a wire, certain changes take place in the
plates, the water, the wire, and the space round the
wire, electric force is again exerted and a current of
electricity is said to flow in the wire. Again, certain
bodies, such as the lodestone, or pieces of iron and
steel which have been treated in a certain manner,
exhibit phenomena of action at a distance: they are
said to exert magnetic force, and it is found that this
magnetic force exists in the neighbourhood of an
electric current and is connected with the current.</p>

<p>Again, when electric force is applied to a body, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
effects may be in part electrical, in part mechanical;
the electrical state of the body is in general changed,
while in addition, mechanical forces tending to move
the body are set up. Experiment must teach us how
the electrical state depends on the electric force, and
what is the connection between this electric force and
the magnetic forces which may, under certain circumstances,
be observed. Now, in specifying the electric
and magnetic conditions of the system, various other
quantities, in addition to the electric force, will have
to be introduced; the first step is to formulate the
necessary quantities, and to determine the relations
between them and the electric force.</p>

<p>Consider now a wire connecting the two poles of
an electric battery—in its simplest form, a piece of
zinc and a piece of copper in a vessel of dilute acid—electric
force is produced at each point of the wire.
Let us suppose this force known; an electric current
depending on the material and the size of the wire
flows along it, its value can be determined at each
point of the wire in terms of the electric force by
Ohm’s law. If we take either this current or the
electric force as known, we can determine by known
laws the electric and magnetic conditions elsewhere.
If we suppose the wire to be straight and very long,
then, so long as the current is steady and we neglect
the small effect due to the electrostatic charge on the
wire, there is no electric force outside the wire. There
is, however, magnetic force, and it is found that the
lines of magnetic force are circles round the wire. It
is found also that the work done in travelling once
completely round the wire against the magnetic force<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
is measured by the current flowing through the wire,
and is obtained in the system of units usually adopted
by multiplying the current by 4π. This last result then
gives us one of the necessary relations, that between
the magnetic force due to a current and the strength
of the current.</p>

<p>Again, consider a steady current flowing in a
conductor of any form or shape, the total flow of
current across any section of the conductor can be
measured in various ways, and it is found that at any
time this total flow is the same for each section of the
conductor. In this respect the flow of a current resembles
that of an incompressible fluid through a
pipe; where the pipe is narrow the velocity of flow
is greater than it is where the pipe is broad, but the
total quantity crossing each section at any given
instant is the same.</p>

<p>Consider now two conducting bodies, two spheres,
or two flat plates placed near together but insulated.
Let each conductor be connected to one of the poles
of the battery by a conducting wire. Then, for a very
short interval after the contact is made, it is found
that there is a current in each wire which rapidly dies
away to zero. In the neighbourhood of the balls
there is electric force; the balls are said to be charged
with electricity, and the lines of force are curved lines
running from one ball to the other. It is found that
the balls slightly attract each other, and the space
between them is now in a different condition from what
it was before the balls were charged. According to
Maxwell, <em>Electric Displacement</em> has been produced
in this space, and the electric displacement at each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
point is proportional to the electric force at that
point.</p>

<p>Thus, (i) when electric force acts on a conductor, it
produces a current, the current being by Ohm’s law
proportional to the force: (ii) when it acts on an
insulator it produces electric displacement, and the
displacement is proportional to the force; while (iii)
there is magnetic force in the neighbourhood of the
current, and the work done in carrying a magnetic
pole round any complete circuit linked with the
current is proportional to the current. The first two
of these principles give us two sets of equations connecting
together the electric force and the current
in a conductor or the displacement in a dielectric
respectively; the third connects the magnetic force
and the current.</p>

<p>Now let us go back to the variable period when
the current is flowing in the wires; and to make ideas
precise, let the two conductors be two equal large flat
plates placed with their faces parallel, and at some
small distance apart. In this case, when the plates
are charged, and the current has ceased, the electric
displacement and the force are confined almost entirely
to the space between the plates. During the variable
period the total flow at any instant across each section
of the wire is the same, but in the ordinary sense of
the word there is no flow of electricity across the
insulating medium between the plates. In this space,
however, the electric displacement is continuously
changing, rising from zero initially to its final steady
value when the current ceases. It is a fundamental
part of Maxwell’s theory that this variation of electric<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
displacement is equivalent in all respects to a current.
The current at any point in a dielectric is measured
by the rate of change of displacement at that point.</p>

<p>Moreover, it is also an essential point that if we
consider any section of the dielectric between the two
plates, the rate of change of the total displacement
across this section is at each moment equal to the
total flow of current across each section of the conducting
wire.</p>

<p>Currents of electricity, therefore, including displacement
currents, always flow in closed circuits,
and obey the laws of an incompressible fluid in
that the total flow across each section of the circuit—conducting
or dielectric—is at any moment the
same.</p>

<p>It should be clearly remembered that this fundamental
hypothesis of Maxwell’s theory is an assumption
only to be justified by experiment. Von
Helmholtz, in his paper on “The Equations of
Motion of Electricity for Bodies at Rest,” formed
his equations in an entirely different manner from
Maxwell, and arrived at results of a more general
character, which do not require us to suppose that
currents flow always in closed circuits, but permit of
the condensation of electricity at points in the circuit
where the conductors end and the non-conducting
part of the circuit begins. We leave for the present
the question which of the two theories, if either,
represents the facts.</p>

<p>We have obtained above three fundamental relations—(i)
that between electric force and electric
current in a conductor; (ii) that between electric<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
force and electric displacement in a dielectric; (iii)
that between magnetic force and the current which
gives rise to it. And we have seen that an electric
current—<i>i.e.</i> in a dielectric the variation of the
strength of an electric field of force—gives rise to
magnetic force. Now, magnetic force acting on a
medium produces “magnetic displacement,” or magnetic
induction, as it is called. In all media except
iron, nickel, cobalt, and a few other substances, the
magnetic induction is proportional to the magnetic
force, and the ratio between the magnetic induction
produced by a given force and the force is found to
be very nearly the same for all such media. This
ratio is known as the permeability, and is generally
denoted by the symbol μ.</p>

<p>A relation reciprocal to that given in (iii) above
might be anticipated, and was, in fact, discovered by
Faraday. Changes in a field of magnetic induction
give rise to electric force, and hence to displacement
currents in a dielectric or to conduction currents in
a conductor. In considering the relation between
these changes and the electric force, it is simplest
at first not to deal with magnetic matter such as
iron, nickel, or cobalt; and then we may say that (iv)
the work which at any instant would be done in
carrying a unit quantity of electricity round a
closed circuit in a magnetic field against the electric
forces due to the field is equal to the rate at which
the total magnetic induction which threads the
circuit is being decreased. This law, summing up
Faraday’s experiments on electro-magnetic induction,
gives a fourth principle, leading to a fourth series<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
of equations connecting together the electric and
magnetic quantities involved.</p>

<p>The equations deduced from the above four
principles, together with the condition implied in
the continuity of an electric current, constitute
Maxwell’s equations of the electro-magnetic field.</p>

<p>If we are dealing only with a dielectric medium,
the reciprocal relation between the third and fourth
principle may be made more clear by the following
<span class="locked">statement:—</span></p>

<p>(A) The work done at any moment in carrying
a unit quantity of magnetism round a closed circuit
in a field in which electric displacement is varying, is
equal to the rate of change of the total electric
displacement through the circuit multiplied by 4 π.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a></p>

<p>(B) The work done at any moment in carrying a
unit quantity of electricity round a circuit in a field
in which the magnetic induction is varying, is equal
to the rate of change of the total magnetic induction
through the circuit.</p>

<p>From these two principles, combined with the
laws connecting electric force and displacement,
magnetic force and induction, and with the condition
of continuity, Maxwell obtained his equations of the
field.</p>

<p>Faraday’s experiments on electro-magnetic induction
afford the proof of the truth of the fourth
principle. It follows from those experiments that
when the number of lines of magnetic induction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
which are linked with any closed circuit are made
to vary, an induced electromotive force is brought
into play round that circuit. This electromotive force
is, according to Faraday’s results, measured by the
rate of decrease in the number of lines of magnetic
induction which thread the circuit. Maxwell applies
this principle to all circuits, whether conducting or not.</p>

<p>In obtaining equations to express in symbols
the results of the fourth principle just enunciated,
Maxwell introduces a new quantity, to which he gives
the name of the “vector potential.” This quantity
appears in his analysis, and its physical meaning is
not at first quite clear. Professor Poynting has, however,
put Maxwell’s principles in a slightly different
form, which enables us to see definitely the meaning of
the vector potential, and to deduce Maxwell’s equations
more readily from the fundamental statements.</p>

<p>We are dealing with a circuit with which lines
of magnetic induction are linked, while the number
of such lines linked with the circuit is varying. Now,
let us suppose the variation to take place in consequence
of the lines of induction moving outwards
or inwards, as the case may be, so as to cut the circuit.
Originally there are none linked with the circuit. As
the magnetic field has grown to its present strength
lines of magnetic induction have moved inwards.
Each little element of the circuit has been cut by some,
and the total number linked with the circuit can be
found by adding together those cut by each element.
Now, Professor Poynting’s statement of Maxwell’s
fourth principle is that the electrical force in the
direction of any element of the circuit is found by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
dividing by the length of the element the number of
lines of magnetic induction which are cut in one
second by it.</p>

<p>Moreover, the total number of lines of magnetic induction
which have been cut by an element of unit
length is defined as the component of the vector
potential in the direction of the element; hence the
electrical force in any direction is the rate of decrease
of the component of the vector potential in that
direction. We have thus a physical meaning for the
vector potential, and shall find that in the dynamical
theory this quantity is of great importance.</p>

<p>Professor Poynting has modified Maxwell’s third
principle in a similar manner; he looks upon the
variation in the electric displacement as due to the
motion of tubes of electric induction,<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> and the magnetic
force along any circuit is equal to the number
of tubes of electric induction cutting or cut by unit
length of the circuit per second, multiplied by 4π.</p>

<p>From the equations of the field, as found by
Maxwell, it is possible to derive two sets of symmetrical
equations. The one set connects the rate of
change of the electric force with quantities depending
on the magnetic force; the other set connects in a
similar manner the rate of change of the magnetic
force with quantities depending on the electric force.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
Several writers in recent years adopt these equations
as the fundamental relations of the field, establishing
them by the argument that they lead to consequences
which are found to be in accordance with experiment.</p>

<p>We have endeavoured to give some account of
Maxwell’s historical method, according to which the
equations are deduced from the laws of electric
currents and of electro-magnetic induction derived
directly from experiment.</p>

<p>While the manner in which Maxwell obtained
his equations is all his own, he was not alone in
stating and discussing general equations of the electro-magnetic
field. The next steps which we are about
to consider are, however, in a special manner due
to him. An electrical or magnetic system is the
seat of energy; this energy is partly electrical, partly
magnetic, and various expressions can be found for
it. In Maxwell’s theory it is a fundamental assumption
that energy has position. “The electric and magnetic
energies of any electro-magnetic system,” says
Professor Poynting, “reside, therefore, somewhere in
the field.” It follows from this that they are present
wherever electric and magnetic force can be shown to
exist. Maxwell showed that all the electric energy is
accounted for by supposing that in the neighbourhood
of a point at which the electric force is R there is
an amount of energy per unit of volume equal to
KR²/8π, K being the inductive capacity of the
medium, while in the neighbourhood of a point at
which the magnetic force is H, the magnetic energy
per unit of volume is μH²/8π, μ being the permeability.
He supposes, then, that at each point of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
an electro-magnetic system energy is stored according
to these laws. It follows, then, that the electro-magnetic
field resembles a dynamical system in
which energy is stored. Can we discover more of
the mechanism by which the actions in the field
are maintained? Now the motion of any point of a
connected system depends on that of other points of
the system; there are generally, in any machine, a
certain number of points called driving-points, the
motion of which controls the motion of all other
parts of the machine; if the motion of the driving-points
be known, that of any other point can be determined.
Thus in a steam engine the motion of a
point on the fly-wheel can be found if the motion of
the piston and the connections between the piston
and the wheel be known.</p>

<p>In order to determine the force which is acting on
any part of the machine we must find its momentum,
and then calculate the rate at which this momentum
is being changed. This rate of change will give us
the force. The method of calculation which it is
necessary to employ was first given by Lagrange, and
afterwards developed, with some modifications, by
Hamilton. It is usually referred to as Hamilton’s
principle; when the equations in the original form
are used they are known as Lagrange’s equations.</p>

<p>Now Maxwell showed how these methods of calculation
could be applied to the electro-magnetic field.
The energy of a dynamical system is partly kinetic,
partly potential. Maxwell supposes that the magnetic
energy of the field is kinetic energy, the electric
energy potential. When the kinetic energy of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
system is known, the momentum of any part of the
system can be calculated by recognised processes.
Thus if we consider a circuit in an electro-magnetic
field we can calculate the energy of the field, and
hence obtain the momentum corresponding to this
circuit. If we deal with a simple case in which the
conducting circuits are fixed in position, and only the
current in each circuit is allowed to vary, the rate of
change of momentum corresponding to any circuit
will give the force in that circuit. The momentum
in question is electric momentum, and the force is
electric force. Now we have already seen that the
electric force at any point of a conducting circuit is
given by the rate of change of the vector potential
in the direction considered. Hence we are led to
identify the vector potential with the electric momentum
of our dynamical system; and, referring to
the original definition of vector potential, we see that
the electric momentum of a circuit is measured by the
number of lines of magnetic induction which are
interlinked with it.</p>

<p>Again, the kinetic energy of a dynamical system
can be expressed in terms of the squares and products
of the velocities of its several parts. It can also be
expressed by multiplying the velocity of each driving-point
by the momentum corresponding to that driving-point,
and taking half the sum of the products.
Suppose, now, we are dealing with a system consisting
of a number of wire circuits in which currents are
running, and let us suppose that we may represent
the current in each wire as the velocity of a driving-point
in our dynamical system. We can also express<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
in terms of these currents the electric momentum of
each wire circuit; let this be done, and let half the
sum of the products of the corresponding velocities
and momenta be formed.</p>

<p>In maintaining the currents in the wires energy is
needed to supply the heat which is produced in each
wire; but in starting the currents it is found that
more energy is needed than is requisite for the supply
of this heat. This excess of energy can be calculated,
and when the calculation is made it is found that the
excess is equal to half the sum of the products of the
currents and corresponding momenta. Moreover, if
this sum be expressed in terms of the magnetic force,
it is found to be equal to μ H²/8 π, which is the magnetic
energy of the field. Now, when a dynamical
system is set in motion against known forces, more
energy is supplied than is needed to do the work
against the forces; this excess of energy measures the
kinetic energy acquired by the system.</p>

<p>Hence, Maxwell was justified in taking the magnetic
energy of the field as the kinetic energy of the
mechanical system, and if the strengths of the currents
in the wires be taken to represent the velocities of the
driving-points, this energy is measured in terms of
the electrical velocities and momenta in exactly the
same way as the energy of a mechanical system is
measured in terms of the velocities and momenta of
its driving-points.</p>

<p>The mechanical system in which, according to
Maxwell, the energy is stored is the ether. A state of
motion or of strain is set up in the ether of the field.
The electric forces which drive the currents, and also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
the mechanical forces acting on the conductors carrying
the currents, are due to this state of motion, or it
may be of strain, in the ether. It must not be supposed
that the term electric displacement in Maxwell’s
mind meant an actual bodily displacement of the
particles of the ether; it is in some way connected
with such a material displacement. In his view, without
motion of the ether particles there would be no
electric action, but he does not identify electric
displacement and the displacement of an ether
particle.</p>

<p>His mechanical theory, however, does account for
the electro-magnetic forces between conductors carrying
currents. The energy of the system depends on
the relative positions of the currents which form part
of it. Now, any conservative mechanical system
tends to set itself in such a position that its potential
energy is least, its kinetic energy greatest. The
circuits of the system, then, will tend to set themselves
so that the electro-kinetic energy of the system may
be as large as possible; forces will be needed to hold
them in any position in which this condition is not
satisfied.</p>

<p>We have another proof of the correctness of the
value found for the energy of the field in that the
forces calculated from this value agree with those
which are determined by direct experiment.</p>

<p>Again, the forces applied at the various driving-points
are transmitted to other points by the connections
of the machine; the connections are thrown
into a state of strain; stress exists throughout their
substance. When we see the piston-rod and the shaft<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
of an engine connected by the crank and the connecting-rod,
we recognise that the work done on the
piston is transmitted thus to the shaft. So, too, in
the electro-magnetic field, the ether forms the connection
between the various circuits in the field;
the forces with which those circuits act on each other
are transmitted from one circuit to another by the
stresses set up in the ether.</p>

<p>To take another instance, consider the electrostatic
attraction between two charged bodies. Let us
suppose the bodies charged by connecting each to
the opposite pole of a battery; a current flows from
the battery setting up electric displacement in the
space between the bodies, and throwing the ether into
a state of strain. As the strain increases the current
gets less; the reaction resulting from the strain tends
to stop it, until at last this reaction is so great that
the current is stopped. When this is the case the
wires to the battery may be removed, provided this is
done without destroying the insulation of the bodies;
the state of strain will remain and shows itself in the
attraction between the balls.</p>

<p>Looking at the problem in this manner, we are
face to face with two great questions—the one, What
is the state of strain in the ether which will enable it
to produce the observed electrostatic attractions and
repulsions between charged bodies? and the other,
What is the mechanical structure of the ether which
would give rise to such a state of strain as will
account for the observed forces? Maxwell gives one
answer to the first question; it is not the only answer
which could be given, but it does account for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
facts. He failed to answer the second. He says
(“Electricity and Magnetism,” vol. i. <span class="locked">p. 132):—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It must be carefully borne in mind that we have made
only one step in the theory of the action of the medium. We
have supposed it to be in a state of stress, but have not in any
way accounted for this stress, or explained how it is maintained....
I have not been able to make the next step, namely, to
account by mechanical considerations for these stresses in the
dielectric.”</p>
</div>

<p>Faraday had pointed out that the inductive action
between two bodies takes place along the lines of
force, which tend to shorten along their length and
to spread outwards in other directions. Maxwell
compares them to the fibres of a muscle, which
contracts and at the same time thickens when
exerting force. In the electric field there is, on
Maxwell’s theory, a tension along the lines of electric
force and a pressure at right angles to those lines.
Maxwell proved that a tension K R²/8 π along the
lines of force, combined with an equal pressure in
perpendicular directions, would maintain the equilibrium
of the field, and would give rise to the observed
attractions or repulsions between electrified bodies.
Other distributions of stress might be found which
would lead to the same result. The one just stated
will always be connected with Maxwell’s name. It
will be noticed that the tension along the lines of
force and the pressure at right angles to them are
each numerically equal to the potential energy stored
per unit of volume in the field. The value of each of
the three quantities is K R²/8 π.</p>

<p>In the same way, in a magnetic field, there is
a state of stress, and on Maxwell’s theory this, too,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
consists of a tension along the lines of force and an
equal pressure at right angles to them, the values
of the tension and the pressure being each equal
to that of the magnetic energy per unit of volume,
or μH²/8π.</p>

<p>In a case in which both electric and magnetic
force exists, these two states of stress are superposed.
The total energy per unit of volume is
KR²/8π + μH²/8π; the total stress is made up
of tensions KR²/8π and μH²/8π along the lines
of electric and magnetic force respectively, and equal
pressures at right angles to these lines.</p>

<p>We see, then, from Maxwell’s theory, that electric
force produced at any given point in space is transmitted
from that point by the action of the ether.
The question suggests itself, Does the transmission
take time, and if so, does it proceed with a definite
velocity depending on the nature of the medium
through which the change is proceeding?</p>

<p>According to the molecular-vortex theory, we
have seen that waves of electric force are transmitted
with a definite velocity. The more general theory
developed in the “Electricity and Magnetism” leads
to the same result. Electric force produced at any
point travels outwards from that point with a velocity
given by 1/√(Kμ). At a distant point the force is
zero, until the disturbance reaches it. If the disturbance
last only for a limited interval, its effects
will at any future time be confined to the space
within a spherical shell of constant thickness depending
on the interval; the radii of this shell increase
with uniform speed 1/√(Kμ).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span></p>

<p>If the initial disturbance be periodic, periodic
waves of electric force will travel out from the centre,
just as waves of sound travel out from a bell, or waves
of light from a candle flame. A wire carrying an
alternating current may be such a source of periodic
disturbance, and from the wire waves travel outwards
into space.</p>

<p>Now, it is known that in a sound wave the displacements
of the air particles take place in the
direction in which the wave is travelling; they lie
at right angles to the wave front, and are spoken of
as longitudinal. In light waves, on the other hand,
the displacements are, as Fresnel proved, in the wave
front, at right angles, that is, to the direction of
propagation; they are transverse.</p>

<p>Theory shows that in general both these waves
may exist in an elastic solid body, and that they
travel with different velocities. Of which nature are
the waves of electric displacement in a dielectric?
It can be shewn to follow as a necessary consequence
of Maxwell’s views as to the closed character of all
electric currents, that waves of electric displacement
are transverse. Electric vibrations, like those of light,
are in the wave front and at right angles to the direction
of propagation; they depend on the rigidity or quasi-rigidity
of the medium through which they travel,
not on its resistance to compression.</p>

<p>Again, an electric current, whether due to variation
of displacement in a dielectric or to conduction
in a conductor, is accompanied by magnetic force.
A wave of periodic electric displacement, then, will
be also a wave of periodic magnetic force travelling at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
the same rate; and Maxwell shewed that the direction
of this magnetic force also lies in the wave front,
and is always at right angles to the electric displacement.
In the ordinary theory of light the wave of
linear displacement is accompanied by a wave of
periodic angular twist about a direction lying in
the wave front and perpendicular to the linear displacement.</p>

<p>In many respects, then, waves of electric displacement
resemble waves of light, and, indeed, as we
proceed we shall find closer connections still. Hence
comes Maxwell’s electro-magnetic theory of light.</p>

<p>It is only in dielectric media that electric force is
propagated by wave motion. In conductors, although
the third and fourth of Maxwell’s principles given on
page 185 still are true, the relation between the electric
force and the electric current differs from that which
holds in a dielectric. Hence the equations satisfied
by the force are different. The laws of its propagation
resemble those of the conduction of heat rather than
those of the transmission of light.</p>

<p>Again, light travels with different velocities in
different transparent media. The velocity of electric
waves, as has been stated, is equal to 1/√(μK); but
in making this statement it is assumed that the
simple laws which hold where there is no gross
matter—or, rather, where air is the only dielectric
with which we are concerned—hold also in solid or liquid
dielectrics. In a solid or a liquid, as in vacuo,
the waves are propagated by the ether. We assume,
as a first step towards a complete theory, that so far
as the electric waves are concerned the sole effect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
produced by the matter shews itself in a change of
inductive capacity or of permeability. It is not likely
that such a supposition should be the whole truth,
and we may, therefore, expect results deduced from it
to be only approximation to the true result.</p>

<p>Now, electro-magnetic experiments show that,
excluding magnetic substances, the permeability of
all bodies is very nearly the same, and differs very
slightly from that of air. The inductive capacity,
however, of different bodies is different, and hence
the velocity with which electro-magnetic waves travel
differs in different bodies.</p>

<p>But the refraction of waves of light depends on
the fact that light travels with different velocities in
different media; hence we should expect to have
waves of electric displacement reflected and refracted
when they pass from one dielectric, such as air, to
another, such as glass or gutta-percha; moreover,
for light the refractive index of a medium such as
glass is the ratio of the velocity in air to the velocity
in the glass.</p>

<p>Thus the electrical refractive index of glass is the
ratio of the velocity of electric waves in air to their
velocity in glass.</p>

<p>Now let K₀ be the inductive capacity of air, K₁ that
of glass, taking the permeability of air and glass to be
the same, we have the result <span class="locked">that—</span></p>

<p class="center">Electrical refractive index = √(K₁/K₀).
</p>

<p>But the ratio of the inductive capacity of glass to
that of air is known as the specific inductive capacity
of glass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span></p>

<p>Hence, the specific inductive capacity of any
medium is equal to the square of the electrical refractive
index of that medium.</p>

<p>Since Maxwell’s time the mathematical laws of
the reflexion and refraction of electric waves have
been investigated by various writers, and it has been
shewn that they agree exactly with those enunciated
by Fresnel for light.</p>

<p>Hitherto we have been discussing the propagation
of electric waves in an isotropic medium, one which
has identical properties in all directions about a point.
Let us now consider how these laws are modified if
the dielectric be crystalline in structure.</p>

<p>Maxwell assumes that the crystalline character
of the dielectric can be sufficiently represented by
supposing the inductive capacity to be different in
different directions; experiments have since shewn
that this is true for crystals such as Iceland
Spar and Aragonite; he assumes also, and this, too,
is justified by experiment, that the magnetic permeability
does not depend on the direction. It
follows from these assumptions that a crystal will
produce double refraction and polarisation of electric
waves which fall upon it, and, further, that the laws
of double refraction will be those given by Fresnel
for light waves in a doubly refracting medium.
There will be two waves in the crystal. The disturbance
in each of these will be plane polarised;
their velocity and the position of their plane of
polarisation can be found from the direction in which
they are travelling by Fresnel’s construction exactly.</p>

<p>Maxwell’s theory, then, would appear to indicate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
some close connection between electric waves and
those of light. Faraday’s experiments on the rotation
of the plane of polarisation by magnetic force
shew one phenomenon in which the two are connected,
and Maxwell endeavoured to apply his theory
to explain this. Here, however, it became necessary
to introduce an additional hypothesis—there must be
some connection between the motion of the ether
to which magnetic force is due and that which constitutes
light. It is impossible to give a mechanical
account of the rotation of the plane of polarisation
without some assumption as to the relation between
these two kinds of motion. Maxwell, therefore,
supposes the linear displacements of a point in the
ether to be those which give rise to light, while the
components of the magnetic force are connected with
these in the same way as the components of a vortex
in a liquid in vortex motion are connected with the
displacements of the liquid. He further assumes the
existence of a term of special form in the expression
for the kinetic energy, and from these assumptions he
deduces the laws of the propagation of polarised
light in a magnetic field. These laws agree in the
main with the results of Verdet’s experiments.</p>

<span class="subhead">DEVELOPMENT OF MAXWELL’S THEORY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">We</span> have endeavoured in the preceding pages to give
some account of Maxwell’s contributions to electrical
theory and the physics of the ether. We must now
consider very briefly what evidence there is to support
these views. At Maxwell’s death such evidence,
though strong, was indirect. His supporters were
limited to some few English-speaking pupils, young
and enthusiastic, who were convinced, it may be, in
no small measure, by the affection and reverence with
which they regarded their master. Abroad his views
had made very little way.</p>

<p>In the last words of his book he writes, speaking
of various distinguished <span class="locked">workers—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“There appears to be in the minds of these eminent men
some prejudice, or <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">à priori</i> objection, against the hypothesis of
a medium in which the phenomena of radiation of light and
heat, and the electric actions at a distance, take place. It is
true that, at one time, those who speculated as to the causes of
physical phenomena were in the habit of accounting for each
kind of action at a distance by means of a special ætherial
fluid, whose function and property it was to produce these
actions. They filled all space three and four times over with
æthers of different kinds, the properties of which were invented
merely to ‘save appearances,’ so that more rational
enquirers were willing rather to accept not only Newton’s
definite law of attraction at a distance, but even the dogma of
Cotes,<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> that action at a distance is one of the primary properties
of matter, and that no explanation can be more intelligible
than this fact. Hence the undulatory theory of light<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
has met with much opposition, directed not against its failure
to explain the phenomena, but against its assumption of the
existence of a medium in which light is propagated.</p>

<p>“We have seen that the mathematical expression for
electro-dynamic action led, in the mind of Gauss, to the conviction
that a theory of the propagation of electric action in
time would be found to be the very key-stone of electro-dynamics.
Now we are unable to conceive of propagation in
time, except either as the flight of a material substance through
space, or as the propagation of a condition of motion, or stress,
in a medium already existing in space.</p>

<p>“In the theory of Neumann, the mathematical conception
called potential, which we are unable to conceive as a material
substance, is supposed to be projected from one particle to
another in a manner which is quite independent of a medium,
and which, as Neumann has himself pointed out, is extremely
different from that of the propagation of light.</p>

<p>“In the theories of Riemann and Betti it would appear
that the action is supposed to be propagated in a manner
somewhat more similar to that of light.</p>

<p>“But in all of these theories the question naturally occurs:—If
something is transmitted from one particle to another at a
distance, what is its condition after it has left one particle and
before it has reached the other? If this something is the
potential energy of the two particles, as in Neumann’s theory,
how are we to conceive this energy as existing in a point of
space, coinciding neither with the one particle nor with the
other? In fact, whenever energy is transmitted from one body
to another in time, there must be a medium or substance in
which the energy exists after it leaves one body and before it
reaches the other, for energy, as Torricelli<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a> remarked, ‘is a
quintessence of so subtle a nature that it cannot be contained
in any vessel except the inmost substance of material things.’
Hence all these theories lead to a conception of a medium in
which the propagation takes place, and if we admit this
medium as an hypothesis, I think it ought to occupy a prominent
place in our investigations, and that we ought to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
endeavour to construct a mental representation of all the
details of its action, and this has been my constant aim in this
treatise.”</p>
</div>

<p>Let us see, then, what were the experimental
grounds in Maxwell’s day for accepting as true his
views on electrical action, and how since then, by the
genius of Heinrich Hertz and the labours of his
followers, those grounds have been rendered so sure
that nearly the whole progress of electrical science
during the last twenty years has consisted in the
development of ideas which are to be found in the
“Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism.”</p>

<p>The purely electrical consequences of Maxwell’s
theory were of course in accord with all known electrical
observations. The equations of the field accounted
for the electro-magnetic forces observed in
various experiments, and from them the laws of electro-magnetic
induction could be correctly deduced; but
there was nothing very special in this. Similar equations
had been obtained from the theory of action at
a distance by various writers; in fact, Helmholtz’s
theory, based on the most general form of expression
for the force between two elements of current consistent
with certain experiments of Ampère’s, was
more general in its character than Maxwell’s. The
destructive features of Maxwell’s theory were:</p>

<p>(1) The assumption that all currents flow in closed
circuits.</p>

<p>(2) The idea of energy residing throughout the
electro-magnetic field in consequence of the strains
and stresses set up in the electro-magnetic medium
by the actions to which it was subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span></p>

<p>(3) The identification of this electro-magnetic
medium with the luminiferous ether, and the consequent
view that light is an electro-magnetic
phenomena.</p>

<p>(4) The view that electro-magnetic forces arise
entirely from strains and stresses set up in the ether;
the electrostatic charge of an insulated conductor
being one of the forms in which the ether strain is
manifested to us.</p>

<p>(5) A dielectric under the action of electric force
is said to become polarised, and, according to Maxwell
(vol. i. p. 133), all electrification is the residual effect
of the polarisation of the dielectric.</p>

<p>Now it must, I think, be admitted that in Maxwell’s
day there was direct proof of very few of these
propositions. No one has even yet so measured the
displacement currents in a dielectric as to show that
the total flow across every section of a circuit is at
any given moment the same, though there are other
experiments of an indirect character which have now
completely justified Maxwell’s hypothesis. Experiments
by Schiller and Von Helmholtz prove it is
true that some action in the dielectric must be taken
into consideration in any satisfactory theory; they
therefore upset various theories based on direct action
at a distance, “but they tell us nothing as to whether
any special form of the dielectric theory, such as
Maxwell’s or Helmholtz’s, is true or not.” (J. J.
Thomson, “Report on Electrical Theories,” B.A. Report,
1885, p. 149.)</p>

<p>When Maxwell died there had been little if any
experimental evidence as to the stresses set up in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
body by electric force. Fontana, Govi, and Duter
had all observed that changes take place in the
volume of the dielectric of a condenser when it is
charged. Quincke had taken up the work, and the
first of his classic papers on this subject was published
in 1880, the year following Maxwell’s death. Maxwell
himself was fond of shewing an experiment in which
a charged insulated sphere was brought near to the
surface of paraffin; the stress on the surface causes a
heaping up of the paraffin under the sphere.</p>

<p>Kerr had shewn in 1875 that many substances
become doubly refracting under electric stress; his
complete determination of the laws of this action was
published at a later date.</p>

<p>As to direct measurements on electric waves, there
were none; the value of the velocity with which, if
Maxwell’s theory were true, they must travel had
been determined from electrical observations of quite
a different character. Weber and Kohlrausch had
measured the value of K for air, for which μ is unity,
and from their observations it follows that the value
of the wave velocity for electro-magnetic waves is
about 31 × 10⁹ centimetres per second. The velocity
of light was known, from the experiments of Fizeau
and Foucault, to have about this value, and it was the
near coincidence of these two values which led Maxwell
to write in <span class="locked">1864:—</span></p>

<p>“The agreement of the results seems to show that
light and magnetism are affections of the same
substance, and that light is an electro-magnetic
disturbance propagated through the field according
to electro-magnetic laws.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span></p>

<p>By the time the first edition of the “Electricity
and Magnetism” was published, Maxwell and Thomson
(Lord Kelvin) had both made determinations of K,
and had shewn that for air at least the resulting value
for the velocity of electro-magnetic waves was very
nearly that of light.</p>

<p>For other substances at that date the observations
were fewer still. Gibson and Barclay had determined
the specific inductive capacity of paraffin, and found
that its square root was 1·405, while its refractive index
for long waves is 1·422. Maxwell himself thought
that if a similar agreement could be shewn to hold
for a number of substances, we should be warranted
in concluding that “the square root of K, though it
may not be the complete expression for the index of
refraction, is at least the most important term in it.”</p>

<p>Between this time and Maxwell’s death enough
had been done to more than justify this statement.
It was clear from the observations of Boltzmann,
Silow, Hopkinson, and others that there were many
substances for which the square root of the specific
inductive capacity was very nearly indeed equal to
the refractive index, and good reason had been given
why in some cases there should be a considerable
difference between the two.</p>

<p>Hopkinson found that in the case of glass the
differences were very large, and they have since been
found to be considerable for most solids examined,
with the exception of paraffin and sulphur. For
petroleum oil, benzine, toluene, carbon-bisulphide, and
some other liquids the agreement between Maxwell’s
theory and experiment is close. For the fatty oils,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
such as castor oil, olive oil, sperm oil, neatsfoot oil,
and also for ether, the differences are considerable.</p>

<p>It seems probable that the reason for this difference
lies in the fact that, in the light waves, we are dealing
with the wave velocity of a disturbance of an extremely
short period. Now, we know that the substances
mentioned shew optical dispersion, and we
have at present no completely satisfactory theory from
which we can calculate, from experiments on very
short waves, what the velocity for very long waves
will be. In most cases Cauchy’s formula has been
used to obtain the numbers given. The value of K,
however, as found by experiment, corresponds to these
infinitely long waves, and to quote Professor J. J.
Thomson’s words, “the marvel is not that there
should not be substances for which the relation K
= μ² does not hold, but that there should be any for
which it does.”<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a></p>

<p>It has been shewn, moreover, both by Professor J.
J. Thomson himself and by Blondlot, that when the
value of K is measured under very rapidly varying
electrifications, changing at the rate of about 25,000,000
to the second, the value of the inductive capacity for
glass is reduced from about 6·8 or 7 to about 2·7; the
square root of this is 1·6, which does not differ much
from its refractive index. The values of the inductive
capacity of paraffin and sulphur, which it will be
remembered agree fairly with Maxwell’s theory, were
found to be not greatly different in the steady and
in the rapidly varying field.</p>

<p>On the other hand, some experiments of Arons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
and Rubens in rapidly varying fields lead to values
which do not differ greatly from those given by other
methods. The theory, however, of these experiments
seems open to criticism.</p>

<p>To attempt anything like a complete account of
modern verifications of Maxwell’s views and modern
developments of his theory is a task beyond our
limits, but an account of Maxwell written in 1895
would be incomplete without a reference to the work
of Heinrich Hertz.</p>

<p>Maxwell told us what the properties of electro-magnetic
waves in air must be. Hertz<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a> in 1887 enabled
us to measure those properties, and the measurements
have verified completely Maxwell’s views.</p>

<p>The method of producing electrical oscillations in
a conductor had long been known. Thomson and Von
Helmholtz had both pointed it out. Schiller had
examined such oscillations in 1874, and had determined
the inductive capacity of glass by their means,
using oscillations whose period varied from ·000056 to
·00012 of a second.</p>

<p>These oscillations were produced by discharging
a condenser through a coil of wire having self-induction.
If the electrical resistance of the coil be
not too great, the charge oscillates backwards and
forwards between the plates of the condenser until its
energy is dissipated in the heat produced in the wire,
and in the electro-magnetic radiations which leave it.</p>

<p>The period of these oscillations under proper
conditions is given by the formula T = 2π√(CL) where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
L, the coefficient of self induction, and <i>C</i> the capacity
of the condenser. These quantities can be calculated,
and hence the time of an oscillation is known. From
such an arrangement waves radiate out into space. If
we could measure by any method the length of such a
wave we could determine its velocity by dividing the
wave length by the period. But it is clear that since
the velocity is comparable with that of light the wave
length will be enormous, unless the period is very
short. Thus, a wave, travelling with the velocity of
light, whose period was ·0001 second, such as the
waves Schiller worked with, would have a length of
·0001 × 30,000,000,000 or 3,000,000 centimetres, and
would be quite unmeasurable. Before measurements
on electric waves could be made it was necessary (1)
to produce waves of sufficiently rapid period, (2) to
devise means to detect them. This is what Hertz did.</p>

<p>The wave length of the electrical oscillations
can be reduced by reducing either the electrical
capacity of the system, or the coefficient of self-induction
of the wire. Hertz adopted both these
expedients. His vibrator, in some of his more important
experiments, consisted of two square brass
plates 40 cm. in the side. To each of these is attached
a piece of copper wire about 30 cm. in length, and each
wire ends in a small highly-polished brass ball. The
plates are placed so that the wires lie in the same
straight line, the brass balls being separated by a very
small air gap. The two plates are then charged, the
one positively the other negatively, until the insulation
resistance of the air gap breaks down and a discharge
passes across. Under these conditions the discharge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
is oscillatory. It does not consist of a single spark,
but of a series of sparks, which pass and repass in
opposite directions, until the energy of the original
charge is radiated into space or dissipated as heat;
the plates are then recharged and the process repeated.
In Hertz’s experiments the oscillator was charged by
being connected to the secondary terminals of an
induction coil.</p>

<p>In 1883 Professor Fitzgerald had called attention
to this method of producing electric waves in air, and
had given two metres as the minimum wave length
which might be attained. In 1870 Herr von Bezold
had actually made observations on the propagation
and reflection of electrical oscillations, but his work,
published as a preliminary communication, had attracted
little notice. Hertz was the first to undertake
in 1887 in a systematic manner the investigation of
the electric waves in air which proceed from such an
oscillator with a view to testing various theories of
electro-magnetic action.</p>

<p>It remained, however, necessary to devise an
apparatus for detecting the waves. When the waves
are incident on a conductor, electric surgings are set
up in the conductor, and may, under proper conditions,
be observed as tiny sparks. Hertz used as his detector
a loop of wire, the ends of which terminated in
two small brass balls. The wire was bent so that the
balls were very close together, and the sparks could
be seen passing across the tiny air gap which separated
them. Such a wire will have a definite period of its
own for oscillations of electricity with which it may
be charged, and if the frequency of the electric waves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
which fall on it agrees with that of the waves which
it can itself emit, the oscillations which are set up in
the wire will be stronger than under other conditions,
the sparks seen will be more brilliant.<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a> Hertz’s resonator
was a circle of wire thirty-five centimetres in
radius, the period for such a resonator would, he
calculated, be the same as that of his vibrator.</p>

<p>There is, however, very considerable difficulty in
determining the period of an electric oscillator from its
dimensions, and the value obtained from calculation
for that of Hertz’s radiator is not very trustworthy.
The complete period is, however, comparable with two
one hundredth millionths of a second; in his original
papers, Hertz, through an error, gave a value greater
than this.</p>

<p>With these arrangements Hertz was able to detect
the presence of electrical radiation at considerable
distances from the radiator; he was also able to
measure its wave length. In the case of sound waves
the existence of nodes and loops formed under proper
conditions is well known. When waves are directly
reflected from a flat surface, interference takes place
between the incident and reflected waves, stationary
vibrations are set up, and nodes and loops—places, that
is, of minimum and of maximum motion respectively—are
formed. The position of these nodes and loops
can be determined by the aid of suitable apparatus,
and it can be shewn that the distance between two
consecutive nodes is half the wave length.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span></p>

<p>Similarly when electrical vibrations fall on a reflector,
a large flat surface of metal, for example,
stationary vibrations due to the interference between
the incident and reflected waves are produced, and
these give rise to electrical nodes and loops. The
position of such nodes and loops can be found by the
use of Hertz’s apparatus, or in other ways, and hence
the length of the electrical waves can be found. The
existence of the nodes and loops shews that the
electric effects are propagated by wave motion. The
length of the waves is found to be definite, since the
nodes and loops recur at equal intervals apart.</p>

<p>If it be assumed that the frequency is known, the
velocity of wave propagation can be determined.
Hertz found from his experiments that in air the
waves travelled with the velocity of light. It appears,
however, that there were two errors in the calculation
which happened to correct each other, so that neither
the value of the frequency given in Hertz’s paper
nor the wave length observed is correct.</p>

<p>By modifying the apparatus it was possible to
measure the wave length of the waves transmitted
along a copper wire, and hence, again assuming the
period of oscillation, to calculate the velocity of wave
propagation along the wire. Hertz made the experiment,
and found from his first observations that the
waves were propagated along the wire with a finite
velocity, but that the velocity differed from that in
air. The half-wave length in the wire was only about
2·8 metres; that in air was about 4·5 metres.</p>

<p>Now, this experiment afforded a crucial test
between the theories of Maxwell and Von Helmholtz.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
According to the former, the waves do not travel in
the wire at all; they travel through the air alongside
the wire, and the wave length observed by Hertz
ought to have been the same as in air. According to
Von Helmholtz, the two velocities observed by Hertz
should have been different, as, indeed, they were, and
the experiment appeared to prove that Maxwell’s
theory was insufficient and that a more general one,
such as that of Von Helmholtz, was necessary. But
other experiments have not led to the same result.
Hertz himself, using more rapid oscillations in some
later measurements, found that the wave length of
the electric waves from a given oscillator was the
same whether they were transmitted through free
space or conducted along a wire.<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a> Lecher and J. J.
Thomson have arrived at the same result; but the
most complete experiments on this point are those of
Sarasin and De la Rive.</p>

<p>It may be taken, then, as established that
Maxwell’s theory is sufficient, and that the greater
generality of Von Helmholtz is unnecessary.</p>

<p>In a later paper Hertz showed that electric
waves could be reflected and refracted, polarised and
analysed, just like light waves. In his introduction
to his “Collected Papers” he writes (<span class="locked">p. 19):—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Casting now a glance backwards, we see that by the
experiments above sketched the propagation in time of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
supposed action at a distance is for the first time proved.
This fact forms the philosophic result of the experiments, and
indeed, in a certain sense, the most important result. The
proof includes a recognition of the fact that the electric forces
can disentangle themselves from material bodies, and can
continue to subsist as conditions or changes in the state of
space. The details of the experiments further prove that the
particular manner in which the electric force is propagated
exhibits the closest analogy<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a> with the propagation of light;
indeed, that it corresponds almost completely to it. The
hypothesis that light is an electrical phenomenon is thus made
highly probable. To give a strict proof of this hypothesis
would logically require experiments upon light itself.</p>

<p>“What we here indicate as having been accomplished by
the experiments is accomplished independently of the correctness
of particular theories. Nevertheless, there is an obvious
connection between the experiments and the theory in connection
with which they were really undertaken. Since the year
1861 science has been in possession of a theory which Maxwell
constructed upon Faraday’s views, and which we therefore
call the Faraday-Maxwell theory. This theory affirms the
possibility of the class of phenomena here discovered just as
positively as the remaining electrical theories are compelled
to deny it. From the outset Maxwell’s theory excelled all
others in elegance and in the abundance of the relations
between the various phenomena which it included.</p>

<p>“The probability of this theory, and therefore the number
of its adherents, increased from year to year. But as long as
Maxwell’s theory depended solely upon the probability of its
results, and not on the certainty of its hypotheses, it could not
completely displace the theories which were opposed to it.</p>

<p>“The fundamental hypotheses of Maxwell’s theory contradicted
the usual views, and did not rest upon the evidence
of decisive experiments. In this connection we can best
characterise the object and the result of our experiments by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
saying: The object of these experiments was to test the
fundamental hypotheses of the Faraday-Maxwell theory, and
the result of the experiments is to confirm the fundamental
hypotheses of the theory.”</p>
</div>

<p>Since Maxwell’s death volumes have been written
on electrical questions, which have all been inspired
by his work. The standpoint from which electrical
theory is regarded has been entirely changed. The
greatest masters of mathematical physics have found,
in the development of Maxwell’s views, a task that
called for all their powers, and the harvest of new
truths which has been garnered has proved most rich.
But while this is so, the question is still often asked,
What is Maxwell’s theory? Hertz himself concludes
the introduction just referred to with his most interesting
answer to this question. Prof. Boltzmann
has made the theory the subject of an important
course of lectures. Poincaré, in the introduction to
his “Lectures on Maxwell’s Theories and the Electro-magnetic
Theory of Light,” expresses the difficulty,
which many feel, in understanding what the theory is.
“The first time,” he says, “that a French reader opens
Maxwell’s book a feeling of uneasiness, often even of
distrust, is mingled with his admiration. It is only
after prolonged study, and at the cost of many efforts,
that this feeling is dissipated. Some great minds
retain it always.” And again he writes: “A French
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">savant</i>, one of those who have most completely
fathomed Maxwell’s meaning, said to me once, ‘I
understand everything in the book except what is
meant by a body charged with electricity.’”</p>

<p>In considering this question, Poincaré’s own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
remark—“Maxwell does not give a mechanical explanation
of electricity and magnetism, he is only
concerned to show that such an explanation is
possible”—is most important.</p>

<p>We cannot find in the “Electricity” an answer to
the question—What is an electric charge? Maxwell
did not pretend to know, and the attempt to give too
great definiteness to his views on this point is apt to
lead to a misconception of what those views were.</p>

<p>On the old theories of action at a distance and of
electric and magnetic fluids attracting according to
known laws, it was easy to be mechanical. It was only
necessary to investigate the manner in which such
fluids could distribute themselves so as to be in equilibrium,
and to calculate the forces arising from the
distribution. The problem of assigning such a
mechanical structure to the ether as will permit of
its exerting the action which occurs in an electro-magnetic
field is a harder one to solve, and till it is
solved the question—What is an electric charge?—must
remain unanswered. Still, in order to grasp
Maxwell’s theory this knowledge is not necessary.</p>

<p>The properties of ether in dielectrics and in conductors
must be quite different. In a dielectric the
ether has the power of storing energy by some change
in its configuration or its structure; in a conductor this
power is absent, owing probably to the action of the
matter of which the conductor is composed.</p>

<p>When we are said to charge an insulated conductor
we really act on the ether in the neighbourhood of the
body so as to store it with energy; if there be another
conductor in the field we cannot store energy in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
ether it contains. As, then, we pass from the outside
of this conductor to its interior there is a sudden
change in some mechanical quantity connected with
the ether, and this change shows itself as a force of
attraction between the two conductors. Maxwell
called the change in structure, or in property, which
occurs when a dielectric is thus stored with electrostatic
energy, <em>Electric Displacement</em>; if we denote
it by D, then the electric force R is equal to 4πD/K,
and hence the energy in a unit of volume is 2πD²/K,
where K is a quantity depending on the insulator.</p>

<p>Now, D, the electric displacement, is a quantity
which has direction as well as magnitude. Its value,
therefore, at any point can be represented by a straight
line in the usual way; inside a conductor it is zero.
The total change in D, which takes place all over
the surface of a conductor as we enter it from the
outside measures, according to Maxwell, the total
charge on the conductor. At points at which the
lines representing D enter the conductor the charge
is negative; at points at which they leave it the
charge is positive; along the lines of the displacement
there exists throughout the ether a tension measured
by 2πD²/K; at right angles to these lines there is
a pressure of the same amount.</p>

<p>In addition to the above the components of the
displacement D must satisfy certain relations which
can only be expressed in mathematical form, the
physical meaning of which it is difficult to state in
non-mathematical language.</p>

<p>When these relations are so expressed the problem
of finding the value of the displacement at all points<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
of space becomes determinate, and the forces acting
on the conductors can be obtained. Moreover, the
total change of displacement on entering or leaving
a conductor can be calculated, and this gives the
quantity which is known as the total electrical charge
on the conductor. The forces obtained by the above
method are exactly the same as those which would
exist if we supposed each conductor to be charged in
the ordinary sense with the quantities just found, and
to attract or repel according to the ordinary laws.</p>

<p>If, then, we define electric displacement as that
change which takes place in a dielectric when it
becomes the seat of electrostatic energy, and if,
further, we suppose that the change, whatever it be
mechanically, satisfies certain well-known laws, and
that in consequence certain pressures and tensions
exist in the dielectric, electrostatic problems can be
solved without reference to a charge of electricity
residing on the conductors.</p>

<p>Something such as this, it appears to me, is Maxwell’s
theory of electricity as applied to electrostatics.
It is not necessary, in order to understand it, to know
what change in the ether constitutes electric displacement,
or what is an electric charge, though, of course,
such knowledge would render our views more definite,
and would make the theory a mechanical one.</p>

<p>When we turn to magnetism and electro-magnetism,
Maxwell’s theory develops itself naturally.
Experiment proves that magnetic induction is connected
with the rate of change of electric displacement,
according to the laws already given. If, then,
we knew the nature of the change to which the name<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
“electric displacement” has been given, the nature of
magnetic induction would be known. The difficulties
in the way of any mechanical explanation are, it
is true, very great; assuming, however, that some
mechanical conception of “electric displacement” is
possible, Maxwell’s theory gives a consistent account
of the other phenomena of electro-magnetism.</p>

<p>Again, we have, it is true, an electro-magnetic
theory of light, but we do not know the nature of the
change in the ether which affects our eyes with the
sensation of light. Is it the same as electric displacement,
or as magnetic induction, or since, when electric
displacement is varying, magnetic induction always
accompanies it, is the sensation of light due to the
combined effect of the two?</p>

<p>These questions remain unanswered. It may be
that light is neither electric displacement nor magnetic
induction, but some quite different periodic change of
structure of the ether, which travels through the
ether at the same rate as these quantities, and obeys
many of the same laws.</p>

<p>In this respect there is a material difference between
the ordinary theory of light and the electro-magnetic
theory. The former is a mechanical theory;
it starts from the assumption that the periodic change
which constitutes light is the ordinary linear displacement
of a medium—the ether—having certain
mechanical properties, and from those properties it
deduces the laws of optics with more or less success.</p>

<p>Lord Kelvin, in his labile ether, has devised a
medium which could exist and which has the
necessary mechanical properties. The periodic linear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
displacements of the labile ether would obey the laws
of light, and from the fundamental hypotheses of the
theory, a mechanical explanation, reasonably satisfactory
in its main features, can be given of most
purely optical phenomena. The relations between
light and electricity, or light and magnetism, are not,
however, touched by this theory; indeed, they cannot
be touched without making some assumption as to
what electric displacement is.</p>

<p>In recent years various suggestions have been
made as to the nature of the change which constitutes
electric displacement. One theory, due to Von Helmholtz,
supposes that the electro-kinetic momentum, or
vector potential of Maxwell, is actually the momentum
of the moving ether; according to another, suggested,
it would appear originally in a crude form
by Challis, and developed within the last few months
in very satisfactory detail by Larmor, the velocity
of the ether is magnetic force; others have been
devised, but we are still waiting for a second Newton
to give us a theory of the ether which shall include
the facts of electricity and magnetism, luminous radiation,
and it may be gravitation.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile we believe that Maxwell has taken the
first steps towards this discovery, and has pointed out
the lines along which the future discoverer must direct
his search, and hence we claim for him a foremost
place among the leaders of this century of science.</p>

measured by Maxwell’s Vector Potential. Its rate of change at any
point of space measures the electromotive force at that point, so far
as it is due to variations of the electric current in neighbouring conductors;
the magnetic induction depends on the first differential
coefficients of the components of the electro-tonic state; the electric
current is related to their second differential coefficients in the same
manner as the density of attracting matter is related to the potential
it produces. In language which is now frequently used in mathematical
physics, the electromotive force at a point due to magnetic
induction is proportioned to the rate of change of the Vector Potential,
the magnetic induction depends on the “curl” of the Vector Potential,
while the electric current is measured by the “concentration” of the
Vector Potential. From a knowledge of the Vector Potential these
other quantities can be obtained by processes of differentiation.</p>

<p>Punctuation, hyphenation, and spelling were made
consistent when a predominant preference was found
in the original book; otherwise they were not changed.</p>

<p>Simple typographical errors were corrected; unpaired
quotation marks were remedied when the change was
obvious, and otherwise left unpaired.</p>

<p>Illustrations in this eBook have been positioned
between paragraphs and outside quotations. In versions
of this eBook that support hyperlinks, the page
references in the List of Illustrations lead to the
corresponding illustrations.</p>

<p>Footnotes, originally at the bottoms of pages,
have been collected, renumbered, and placed
just before the Index.</p>

<p>The Index was not checked for proper alphabetization
or correct page references.</p>

<p>Some values in the original book are known
today to be incorrect, but have not been
changed here.</p>
